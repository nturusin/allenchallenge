The Donald E. Knuth Prize is a prize for outstanding contributions to the foundations of computer science, named after Donald E. Knuth. The Knuth Prize is awarded since 1996 and includes an award of $5000. The prize is awarded by ACM SIGACT and by IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing. Prizes are awarded in alternation at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing and at the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, which are among the most prestigious conferences in theoretical computer science. In contrast with the Gdel Prize, which recognizes outstanding papers, the Knuth Prize is awarded to individuals for their overall impact in the field. Since the prize was instituted in 1996, it has been awarded to: 1996 - Andrew Yao 1997 - Leslie Valiant 1999 - Lszl Lovsz 2000 - Jeffrey Ullman 2002 - Christos Papadimitriou 2003 - Mikls Ajtai 2005 - Mihalis Yannakakis 2007 - Nancy Lynch 2008 - Volker Strassen 2010 - David S.
