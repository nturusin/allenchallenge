Fluorophen (fluorofen) is a fluorinated analog of phenazocine, an opioid drug of the benzomorphan family, which was developed as a radioligand for the purpose of labeling opioid receptors during PET scans (with 18F). Unlike most other benzomorphan derivatives, fluorophen acts as a full agonist of the opioid receptors with preferential affinity for the -opioid receptor (approximately 6x that of morphine), similar but slightly lower affinity for the -opioid receptor (equipotent to [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin), and very low affinity for the -opioid receptor.
