A midget submarine (also called a mini submarine) is any submarine under 150 tons. Typically operated by a crew of one or two but sometimes up to 6 or 9, with little or no on-board living accommodation, they normally work with mother ships, from which they are launched and recovered, and which provide living accommodation for the crew and other support staff. Both military and civilian midget submarines have been built. Military types work with surface ships and other submarines as mother ships. Civilian and non-combatant military types are generally called submersibles, and normally work with surface ships. Most early submarines, such as the United States Navy's Holland and the British Royal Navy's Holland 1, would now be considered midget submarines. Midget submarines are best known for harbor penetration, although only two World War II boats, the British X-craft and the unsuccessful Welman submarine, were specifically designed with this in mind. Japan's Ko-hyoteki class submarines were originally designed to take part in decisive fleet actions. However, as circumstances changed, they ended up tasked with harbor penetration. Germanys various World War II designs were mostly designed to attack Allied shipping off landing beaches and harbors, although the Seehund had a great enough range to attack shipping off the Thames estuary. Midget submarines have also seen some use in support roles. X-craft were used for reconnaissance, and the Seehund was used to carry supplies. A number of modern midget submarines have also been built for submarine rescue. Midget submarines are commonly armed with torpedoes and mines in the form of, for example, detatchable side loads and nose sections. Alternatively they may function as swimmer delivery vehicles to deliver frogmen to the vicinity of their targets, which are then attacked with limpet mines. In civilian use midget submarines are generally called submersibles, commercial submersibles are used in, for example, underwater maintenance, exploration, archaeology and scientific research. Other commercially available submersibles are marketed as novelty tourist attractions and as specialised tenders for wealthy yacht owners. There is also a growing number of amateur submarine builders and submariners who homebuild submersibles as a hobby. FNRS-2 pioneering research submersible Type 7103 DSRVs Osprey class submersibles Sea Pole class bathyscaphe Dragon class bathyscaphe Harmony class bathyscaphe Mobile diving bell QSZ-II submersible Aurora class one-person midget submarine: Aurora (Shuguang, ) midget sub is a Chinese civilian midget sub developed by private firm Wuhan (). Length: 3.6 m, beam: 1.8 m, height: 1.2 m, maximum speed: 20 km/hr, endurance: 10 hr maximum, maximum depth: 20 m. Equipped with a robotic arm and search light to harvest sea cucumbers in mariculture, but can also be deployed for maintenance of underwater structures in harbors/ports. Several foreign countries including North Korea have shown interests and invited the developer to their respective countries to develop similar midget subs, including possible military applications. Aurora class two-people midget submarine: successor of Aurora class one-person midget sub, with dimension increased to 7 m x 2 m x 2 m from the original 3.6 m x 1.8 m x 1.2 m, and the maximum depth is increased to 30 m, while speed and endurance remained the same. Crew is increased to two. As with its predecessor, this two-people version also attracted attention of prospective foreign interests. Tao Xiangli class midget submarine: This homemade submarine is developed by Mr. Tao Xiangli (, 1974 -). To reduce developmental cost, Mr. Tao uses 2nd hand material whenever it was possible, and as result, it only took 30,000 (US$ 4,385) to complete his first boat. For example,the hull is constructed of five used fuel tanks. Tao's submarine weighs 800 kg (1,764 lb) and is 6.5 meters (21 feet) long, with a cramped interior that fits one person and features pressure gauges, monitoring cameras and, of course, an oxygen supply. The electrically powered midget sub shapes like a torpedo with a conning tower, and is able to dive to 10 meter depth. Mr. Tao confirmed that he has received funds for further development, which would enable the next midget sub planned to build to dive to a depth of 50 meters. 2 Italian COS.MO.S CE2F/X100 post-war torpedo chariots 2 Italian COS.MO.S S.X.404 midget submarines: S-1 Haijiao (), S-2 Hailong (), in service from October 8, 1969 to November 1, 1973. S.X.404 is a 70 ton 4-man crew submarine design by Cosmos. Four were sold to Colombia and two to Taiwan in the 1970s. Displaced is 40/70 t (surfaced/submerged), speed is 11/6.5 kn (surfaced/submerged), range is 1200/60 nmi (surfaced/submerged) @ respective maximum speed.

MIR (submersible) for research and submarine rescue FNRS-4 second generation research submersible Nautile research submersible to depth of 6 kilometers France also acquired a number of German midget submarines at the end of WW2. Most German midget submarines were developed late in World War II in an attempt to stop the Allied invasion of Europe and used later to disrupt its supply lines. As a result, the submarines mostly engaged in open water attacks rather than harbour penetration. Biber (324 built by AG Weser of Bremen) Delphin (2 built) 2-man 5-ton torpedo with top speed of 20 knots (37 km/h) and submerged radius of 30 nautical miles (56 km) at 3 knots (5.6 km/h).

The low acoustic and magnetic signature midget sub displaces 28 t, powered by two computerized permanent magnetic electric motors that drive a single shaft low-cavitation and low noise propeller, which is controlled by fly-by-wire control system that is usually adopted for aircraft. The pressure hull is a modular design consisted of four modules that enables easy transportation and maintenance. The Indian Navy is planning to acquire two midget submarines at an estimated cost of 2000 Crores for use as swimmer delivery vehicles.These submarines will be used for conducting underwater special operations by MARCOS. Both submarines will be constructed by Hindustan Shipyard Limited. The Indonesian Navy has shown some interest in having a new Midget Class submarine, built by local shipyards, for coastal rather than open water patrol. The submarine was designed a number of years ago by a retired Indonesian Navy submariner officer, Colonel (Ret) Ir. R. Dradjat Budiyanto, Msc. The midget experiment project involves the construction of a submarine, designated MIDGET IM X 1, which will weigh about 150 250 tonnes, with a tubular frame design 24 30 meters long, and four torpedo tubes. The submarines will have minimum of 8 10 crew members including officers. They will have a 40 km range non-hull-penetrating optronic mast as the attack periscope, and a 20 km range navigation periscope. Indonesian defence minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro has backed the project. Construction should commence at the Indonesian PT.PAL INDONESIA shipyard by late 2011, and will take about three or four years to complete. If this schedule is met, the Indonesian Navy expects to be commissioning the first Midget Class submarine in 2014. Ghadir Nahang Siluro a Lenta Corsa (SLC), also known as Maiale (pig), a low speed human torpedo. On December 3, 1941, the Scir departed La Spezia carrying three Maiale to conduct what became the Raid on Alexandria (1941). At the island of Leros in the Aegean Sea, six Decima Flottiglia MAS crewmen came aboard, including Lieutenant Luigi Durand de la Penne. On December 18 Scir released the manned torpedoes 1.3 miles from Alexandria commercial harbor, and they entered the harbor when the British opened the boom defence to let three of their destroyers pass. After many difficulties, de la Penne and his crewmate Emilio Bianchi successfully attached a limpet mine under HMS Valiant, but had to surface as they attempted to leave and were captured. They refused to answer when questioned and were detained in a compartment aboard Valiant. Fifteen minutes before the explosion, de la Penne asked to speak to the Valiant's captain and informed him of the imminent explosion but refused to give other information. He was returned to the compartment and neither he or Bianchi were injured by the detonation of the mine. The other four torpedo-riders were also captured, but their mines sank the Valiant, the battleship Queen Elizabeth, the Norwegian tanker Sagona and badly damaged the destroyer HMS Jervis. The two battleships sank in only a few feet of water and were subsequently re-floated. Nevertheless they were out of action for over a year. Bathyscaphe Trieste was first to explore the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench CA type First series was a 2 man midget submarine the second series carried a crew of three. CB type 45 ton 4 man design first introduced in 1941 CE2F/X100 post-war torpedo chariot MG 120: MG 120 Shallow water attack submarine (SWATS) is a development of MG 110 in Pakistani service with the displacement is increased to 130 t submerged, range is 1600 nmi @ 7 kn surfaced, 60 nmi @ 4.5 kn submerged, and the number of divers carried is drastically increased to 15. MG 130: MG 130 is a development of MG 120 with AIP module called UAPE (Underwater Auxiliary Propulsion Engine) based on a closed circuit diesel fueled by liquid oxygen, which provides an underwater range of 400 nmi (740 km). Type A K-hyteki-class midget submarines were used in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the 1942 attack on Sydney Harbor, and during the 1942 Allied attack on Diego Suarez Harbor, in which the type 97 torpedo was used operationally. The wreckage of one of the submarines sunk at Pearl Harbor was located by NOAA's Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory (HURL) in August 2002. Photographic analysis conducted by the United States Naval Institute in 1999 indicated that one of the five Ko-hyoteki-class submarines managed to enter Pearl Harbor, and successfully fired a torpedo into the USS West Virginia. On 29 May 1942, one of two midget submarines managed to enter the Diego Suarez harbor and fire two torpedoes. One torpedo seriously damaged the battleship HMS Ramillies, while the second sank the oil tanker British Loyalty (6,993 tons). Type B K-hyteki-class Midget Ha 45 prototype built 1942 to test Type A improvements. Type C K-hyteki-class Midget Ha 6276 similar to Type A with crew of 3 and radius increased to 350 nautical miles (650 km) at 6 knots (11 km/h) surfaced or 120 nautical miles (220 km) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h) submerged. Type D K-hyteki-class, also called Kry class (115 completed) improved Type C with crew of 5 and radius increased to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) at 8 knots (15 km/h) surfaced and 320 miles (510 km) at 16 knots (30 km/h) submerged.

The Royal Navy has used a number of midget submarines. Most were developed during the Second World War. The decommissioning of the Stickleback class marked the end of midget submarines designed for combat in the Royal Navy. Sleeping Beauty Motorized Submersible Canoe (MSC): developed by Special Operations Executive during the Second World War. Chariot manned torpedo: the British developed two types of manned torpedoes; the Chariot Mark I, of 1.6 ton, and the Chariot Mark II, of 2.3 ton. Sixty-four units were built. Stickleback class: a post Second World War development of the XE class. X class: used to attack German warships in the north of Norway. One notable target of a successful attack was the battleship Tirpitz. The submarines had a crew of three (plus a diver) and carried two large mines containing Amatol one on each side. Their strategy was to lay mines on the sea bottom beneath the target, set a time fuse, and leave. XE class: used in the Far East against Japan, where they carried out a number of attacks and special missions. Welman submarine: a single-person submersible widely considered a failure. Aluminaut DSV Alvin (DSV-2) DSRV-2 Avalon DSRV-1 Mystic Nemo (DSV-5) DSV Sea Cliff (DSV-4) of the Alvin class Bathyscaphe Trieste II (DSV-1) DSV Turtle (DSV-3) of the Alvin class X-1 Una-class midget submarine.
