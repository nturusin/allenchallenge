Although the phylogenetic classification of non-vertebrate animals (both extinct and extant) remains a work-in-progress, the following taxonomy attempts to be useful by combining both traditional (old) and new (21st-century) paleozoological terminology. The paleobiologic systematics which follows is not intended to be all-inclusive or completely comprehensive. For practical reasons and relevancy, the below classification and annotations emphasize invertebrates that (a) are popularly collected as fossils and/or (b) no longer continue alive on this planet. Therefore, as a result, some phyla, classes, and orders of invertebrates are not listed. If a non-vertebrate animal is mentioned below using its common, or vernacular name, the creature is usually a living, present-day invertebrate. But if a non-vertebrate is cited below by its scientific, taxonomic genus (in italics), then it is typically an extinct invertebrate, known only from the fossil record. Invertebrate clades that are (a) very important as fossils (for example, ostracods frequently used as index fossils), and/or (b) very abundant as fossils (for example, crinoids easily found in crinoidal limestone), are highlighted with a bracketed exclamation mark [ ! ]. Invertebrate groups that (a) are now substantially extinct, and/or (b) contain a large proportion of extinct species, are followed by a dashed notation [ such as this ]. But invertebrate clades which are now completely extinct are designated with a bracketed dagger [ ]: (eukaryotes / eukaryans / all cellular organisms bearing a central, organized nucleus with DNA) comprises most of the species of life which have been documented by biologists and paleontologists as either living or deceased includes a wide variety of single-celled protists, all algae, most plankton, most molds, the green plants, and all animal-related kingdoms but does not include the primal, sub-nuclear, prokaryotic domains of Archaea and Bacteria nor the enigmatic domain of Viruses (opisthokonts / the animal-related kingdoms / the proto-spongal choanoflagellates, proto-fungal microsporidians, true fungi, and true animals comprises most life forms documented as either living or deceased excludes many molds, all one-celled protists (or protoctists), all algae, and all green plants (metazoans / many-celled true animals / multi-cellular creatures that grab and ingest their organic food) comprises most living and deceased species which have ever been recorded by paleontological and life scientists excludes all unicellular and fungal opisthokonts (parazoans / typically sessile, basal non-eumetazoans / the most-primitive animals / the simplest, colonial, attached, bottom-dwelling, marine invertebrates) (cone-shaped archaeocyathids/archeocyathids / cup-shaped archaeocyathans/archeocyathans / reef-building pleosponges / calcareous "ancient-cups") (includes fossil genera such Archaeocyathus, Cambrocyathus, Atikonia, Tumuliolynthus, Kotuyicyathus, Metaldetes, Ajacicyathus and Paranacyathus) (Archaeocyatha is sometimes classified as a class of Porifera below) (quintessential true sponges / marine, colonial, pore-bearing animals / organized collar-flagellates / poriferans;
