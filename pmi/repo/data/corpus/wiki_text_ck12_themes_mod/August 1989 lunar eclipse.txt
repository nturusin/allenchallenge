A total lunar eclipse took place at 0308 UT (GMT) on August 17, 1989, the second of two total lunar eclipses in 1989. The moon passed through the center of the Earth's shadow. It was seen completely over South America, and rising over North America, and setting over Africa, and Europe. This eclipse is the second of four lunar year eclipses occurring at the moon's ascending node. The lunar year series repeats after 12 lunations or 354 days (Shifting back about 10 days in sequential years). Because of the date shift, the Earth's shadow will be about 11 degrees west in sequential events. Lunar saros series 128, repeating every 18 years and 11 days, has a total of 71 lunar eclipse events including 11 total lunar eclipses. It is the third of five Metonic cycle eclipses, each being separated by 19 years: The Metonic cycle repeats nearly exactly every 19 years and represents a Saros cycle plus one lunar year. Because it occurs on the same calendar date, the earth's shadow will in nearly the same location relative to the background stars. The tritos series repeats 31 days short of 11 years at alternating nodes. Sequential events have incremental Saros cycle indices. This series produces 23 total eclipses between June 22, 1880 and August 9, 2120.
