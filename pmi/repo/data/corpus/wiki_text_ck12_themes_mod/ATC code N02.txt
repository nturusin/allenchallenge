ATC code N02 Analgesics is a therapeutic subgroup of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, a system of alphanumeric codes developed by the WHO for the classification of drugs and other medical products. Subgroup N02 is part of the anatomical group N Nervous system. Codes for veterinary use (ATCvet codes) can be created by placing the letter Q in front of the human ATC code: QN02... ATCvet codes without corresponding human ATC codes are cited with the leading Q in the following list. National issues of the ATC classification may include additional codes not present in this list, which follows the WHO version.
