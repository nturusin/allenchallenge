ISO/IEC 27006, part of a growing family of ISO/IEC Information Security Management System (ISMS) standards, the 'ISO/IEC 27000 series', is an information security standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It is titled Information technology - Security techniques - Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management systems. ISO/IEC 27006 lays out formal requirements for accredited organizations which certify other organizations compliant with ISO/IEC 27001. It effectively replaces EA 7/03 (Guidelines for the Accreditation of bodies operating certification/ registration of. Information Security Management Systems). The standard helps ensure that ISO/IEC 27001 certificates issued by accredited organizations are meaningful and trustworthy, in other words it is a matter of assurance.
