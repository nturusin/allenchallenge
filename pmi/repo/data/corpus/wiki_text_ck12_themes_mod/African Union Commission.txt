The Commission of the African Union acts as the executive/administrative branch or secretariat of the AU (and is somewhat analogous to the European Commission). It consists of a number of Commissioners dealing with different areas of policy. The Commission is headquartered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It should be distinguished from the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, (based in Banjul, Gambia), which is a separate body that reports to the African Union. On September 13, 2005 an agreement was reached by the Commission and France whereby France would donate 5 million for the furtherance of African Union activities. Some of the initiatives this money will go to are an African Communication Policy and an African Common Defence Force. The signatory on behalf of the Commission was Bernard Zoba. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is Chairman of the Commission, replacing Jean Ping in July 2012. Erastus Mwencha is Deputy Chairman.
