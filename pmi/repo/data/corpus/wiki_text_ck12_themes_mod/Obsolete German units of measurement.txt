The obsolete units of measurement of German-speaking countries consist of a variety of units, with varying local standard definitions. Some of these units are still used in everyday speech and even in stores and on street markets as shorthand for similar amounts in the metric system. For example, some customers ask for one pound (ein Pfund) of something when they want (exactly) 500 grams. The metric system became compulsory on January 1, 1872, in Germany and on January 1, 1876, in Austria. Some obsolete German units have names similar to units that were traditionally used in other countries, and that are still used in the United Kingdom (imperial units) and the United States (United States customary units). Before the introduction of the metric system in German, almost every town had its own definitions of the units shown below. Often towns posted the local definitions on a wall of the city hall. For example, the front wall of the old city hall (still standing) has two marks which show the "Rudolstdter Elle"; it was to be used in that city. Supposedly by 1810, in Baden alone, there were 112 different standards for the Elle around Germany. A German geographic mile (geographische Meile) is defined as 115 equatorial degrees, equal to 7,420.54 m (24,345.6 ft). A common German mile, land mile, or post mile (Gemeine deutsche Meile, Landmeile, Postmeile) was defined in various ways at different places and different times. After the introduction of the metric system in the 19th century, the Landmeile was generally fixed at 7,500 m (24,606 ft) (the Reichsmeile), but before then there were many local and regional variants (of which some are shown below): The Rute or Ruthe is of Carolingian origin, and was used as a land measure. Many different kinds of Ruthe were used at various times in various parts of the German-speaking world. They were subdivided into differing numbers of local Fu, and were of many different lengths. One source from 1830 lists the following: One hour's travel, used up to the 18th century. In Germany 12 Meile or 3.71 km (2.31 mi), in Switzerland 16,000 ft or 4.88 km. Originally 6 feet, after introduction of the metric system 10 feet. Regional variants from 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in) in Baden to 3 m (9 ft 10 in) in Switzerland. The Lachter was the most common unit of length used in mining in German-speaking areas. Its exact length varied from place to place but was roughly between 1.9 and 2.1 metres (6 ft 3 in and 6 ft 11 in). Distance between elbow and fingertip. In the North, often 2 feet, In Prussia 178 feet, in the South variable, often 2 12 feet. The smallest known German Elle is 402.8 mm (15.86 in), the longest 811 mm (31.9 in). The Fu or German foot varied widely from place to place in the German-speaking world, and also with time. In some places, more than one type of Fu was in use. One source from 1830 gives the following values: Usually 112 foot, but also 111 and 110. Usually 112 inch, but also 110. For firewood, 2.905 m3 (102.6 cu ft) In general, the Nsel was a measure of liquid volume equal to half a Kanne ("jar," "jug," "bottle," "can"). Actual volumes so measured, however, varied from one state or even one city to another. Within Saxony, for example, the "Dresden jar" held approximately 1 US quart or 0.95 litres or 0.83 imperial quarts, so a nsel in Dresden was about 1 US pint (0.47 L; 0.83 imp pt). The full volume of a "Leipzig jar" measured 1.2 liters (1.3 U.S. qt; 1.1 imp qt); the Leipzig nsel was therefore 0.6 liters (0.63 U.S. qt; 0.53 imp qt). The nsel was used in minor commerce, as well as in the household to measure meal, grain, and such. These units of measure were officially valid in Saxony until 1868, when the metric system was introduced. Nevertheless, the old measures have continued in private use for decades. One interesting modification was introduced in Thuringia. There, the nsel was, by extension, also a measure of area; namely, the area of land which could be sown with one nsel of seed or about 19.36 square yards (16.19 m2; 0.00400 acres)
