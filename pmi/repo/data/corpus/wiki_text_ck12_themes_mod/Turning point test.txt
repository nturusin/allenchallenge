In statistical hypothesis testing, a turning point test is a statistical test of the independence of a series of random variables. Maurice Kendall and Alan Stuart describe the test as "reasonable for a test against cyclicity but poor as a test against trend." The test was first published by Irne-Jules Bienaym in 1874. The turning point tests the null hypothesis H0: X1, X2, ..., Xn are independent and identically distributed random variables (iid) against H1: X1, X2, ..., Xn are not iid. We say i is a turning point if the vector X1, X2, ..., Xi, ..., Xn is not monotonic at index i. The number of turning points is the number of maxima and minima in the series. Let T be the number of turning points then for large n, T is approximately normally distributed with mean (2n 4)/3 and variance (16n 29)/90. The test statistic has standard normal distribution. The test can be used to verify the accuracy of a fitted time series model such a that describing irrigation requirements.
