HIV/AIDS was first detected in Canada in 1982. In 2005, there were approximately 58,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 15,000 unaware of their positive status. The total number of infections has increased by about 2,500 per year. Mortality has decreased due to medical advances against HIV/AIDS, especially highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Women have accounted for 27% of new cases and now make up 20% of all cases. HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing most rapidly amongst aboriginal Canadians, with 9% of new infections in 2005. A three-country study of HIV diagnoses between 1999 and 2008 showed higher HIV rates from heterosexual contact among aboriginals, especially women, than non-aboriginal people. This suggested a widening epidemic beyond conventional risk groups among aboriginals. The same study showed much higher rates of HIV diagnoses among aboriginal people in Canada than in Australia and New Zealand. The Canadian government created the Federal Initiative to Address HIV/AIDS in Canada to provide funding for prevention and support programmes to assist vulnerable people as well as research, surveillance, public awareness and evaluation. The Federal Initiative is coordinated through Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Correctional Service Canada.
