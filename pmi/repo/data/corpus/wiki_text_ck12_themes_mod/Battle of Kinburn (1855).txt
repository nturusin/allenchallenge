The Battle of Kinburn (or Kil-Bouroun) was a naval engagement during the final stage of the Crimean War. It took place on the tip of the Kinburn Peninsula (on the south shore of the Dnieper River estuary in today's Ukraine) on 17 October 1855. During the battle, a combined French Navy and British Royal Navy force engaged Russian forts on shore. The battle, although insignificant to the outcome of the war altogether, is notable as an early success of ironclad warships. Although frequently hit, the French ships destroyed the Russian forts within four hours, suffering minimal casualties in the process. This battle, as well as the Battle of Sinop, convinced contemporary navies to abandon wooden warships and focus on armor plating.
