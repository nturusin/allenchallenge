Cast coinage refers to coins made by pouring melted metal into a mold, i.e. casting. It has been used for regular coins, particularly in the Far East, but also on a smaller scale. (e.g. : the ancient Mediterranean world.) The method differs from the current mode of coin production, which is done by striking coin blanks that have been cut out of metal sheets. The method has also been used by forgers. Traditional Far Eastern cast coinsso-called 'cash coins'are the most famous example of cast coinage, and were issued from the 4th century BCE to about 1912 CE, predominantly in bronze, brass or iron. Traditional Far Eastern coins were generally cast base metal coins, although silver and gold bars were also manufactured, e.g. Chinese sycee, Japanese obans and kobans, and Vietnamese lang and tien. Cast potins circulated in Kent from around 100BC to around 50BC. Somewhere between 1 and 100AD cast broze coins were produced Dorset with archaeological evidence pointing towards Hengistbury Head as the source.
