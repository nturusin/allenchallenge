In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Janko group J4 is a sporadic simple group of order 221 33 5 7 113 23 29 31 37 43 = 86775571046077562880 91019. J4 is one of the 26 Sporadic groups. Zvonimir Janko found J4 in 1975 by studying groups with an involution centralizer of the form 21 + 12.3.(M22:2). Its existence and uniqueness was shown using computer calculations by Simon P. Norton and others in 1980. It has a modular representation of dimension 112 over the finite field with 2 elements and is the stabilizer of a certain 4995 dimensional subspace of the exterior square, a fact which Norton used to construct it, and which is the easiest way to deal with it computationally. Aschbacher & Segev (1991) and Ivanov (1992) gave computer-free proofs of uniqueness. Ivanov & Meierfrankenfeld (1999) and Ivanov (2004) gave a computer-free proof of existence by constructing it as an amalgams of groups 210:SL5(2) and (210:24:A8):2 over a group 210:24:A8. The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial. Since 37 and 43 are not supersingular primes, J4 cannot be a subquotient of the monster group. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs. The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 1333; there are two complex conjugate representations of this dimension. The smallest faithful representation over any field is a 112 dimensional representation over the field of 2 elements. The smallest permutation representation is on 173067389 points, with point stabilizer of the form 211M24. These points can be identified with certain "special vectors" in the 112 dimensional representation. It has a presentation in terms of three generators a, b, and c as Kleidman & Wilson (1988) found the 13 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of J4 as follows: 211:M24 - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups; also containing 211:(M22:2), centralizer of involution of class 2B 21+12.3. (M22:2) - centralizer of involution of class 2A - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups 210:PSL(5,2) 23+12. (S5 PSL(3,2)) - containing Sylow 2-subgroups U3(11):2 M22:2 111+2:(5 GL(2,3)) - normalizer of Sylow 11-subgroup PSL(2,32):5 PGL(2,23) U3(3) - containing Sylow 3-subgroups 29:28 Frobenius group 43:14 Frobenius group 37:12 Frobenius group A Sylow 3-subgroup is a Heisenberg group: order 27, non-abelian, all non-trivial elements of order 3.
