4,4-Oxydianiline is an organic compound with the formula O(C6H4NH2)2. It is an ether derivative of aniline. This colourless solid is a useful monomer and cross-linking agent for polymers, especially the polyimides, such as Kapton. 4,4-Oxydianiline is used in the production of a wide variety of polymer resins. The primary use lies in the production of polyimide and poly(ester)imide resins. These resins are used for their temperature-resistant properties and are utilized in products including wire enamels, coatings, film, adhesives, insulating varnishes, coated fabrics, flame-retardant fibers, oil sealants and retainers, insulation for cables and printed circuits, and laminates and composite for aerospace vehicles. Other applications of 4,4-oxydianiline include the production of poly(amide)imide resins (which are used in the manufacture of heat-resistant wire enamels and coatings), as an intermediate in the manufacture of epoxy resins and adhesives, and in the production of aromatic polyether imides. A specific reaction involving industrial use of 4,4-oxydianiline is in the production of thermostable poly(amideurea) acids, which can be prepared from 4,4-oxydianiline, pyromellitic dianhydride, and diisocyanates. These poly(amideurea) acids can be used as intermediates in the syntheses of poly(imideurea)s:
