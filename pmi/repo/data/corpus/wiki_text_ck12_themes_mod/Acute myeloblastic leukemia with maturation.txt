M2 is a subtype of AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). It is also known as "Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia with Maturation". This subtype is characterized by a translocation of a part of chromosome 8 to chromosome 21, written as t(8;21). On both sides of the splice the DNA coded for different proteins, RUNX1 and ETO, These two sequences are then transcribed and translated into a single large protein, "M2 AML" which allows the cell to divide unchecked, leading to cancer.
