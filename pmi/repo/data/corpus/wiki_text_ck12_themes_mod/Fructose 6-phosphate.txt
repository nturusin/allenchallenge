Fructose 6-phosphate (also known as the Neuberg ester) is fructose sugar phosphorylated on carbon 6 (i.e., is a fructosephosphate). The -D-form of this compound is very common in cells. The vast majority of glucose and fructose entering a cell will become converted to this at some point. The name Neuberg ester comes from the German biochemist Carl Neuberg. In 1918, Carl Neuberg found that the compound (only later identified as fructose 6-phosphate) could be produced by mild acid hydrolysis of "Harden-Young ester" (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate). Fructose 6-phosphate lies within the glycolysis metabolic pathway and is produced by isomerisation of glucose 6-phosphate. It is in turn further phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
