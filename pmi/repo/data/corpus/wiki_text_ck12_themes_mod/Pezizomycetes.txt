Pezizomycetes are a class of fungi within the division Ascomycota. Pezizomycetes are apothecial fungi, meaning that their spore-producing/releasing bodies (ascoma) are typically disk-like, bearing on their upper surfaces a layer of cylindrical spore-producing cells called asci, from which the spores are forcibly discharged.
