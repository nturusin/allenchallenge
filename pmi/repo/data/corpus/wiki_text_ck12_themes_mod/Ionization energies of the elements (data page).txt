 ["use" and "WEL" give former in the unit "kJ/mol"; "CRC" gives latter in the unit "eV".] Values from CRC are ionization energies given in the unit eV; other values are molar ionization energies given in the unit kJ/mol. The first of these quantities is used in atomic physics, the second in chemistry, but both refer to the same basic property of the element. To convert from "value of ionization energy" to the corresponding "value of molar ionization energy", multiply the former by 96.48534 kJ/(eVmol).
