In physics, the ARGUS distribution, named after the particle physics experiment ARGUS, is the probability distribution of the reconstructed invariant mass of a decayed particle candidate in continuum background. The probability density function (pdf) of the ARGUS distribution is: for 0 x < c. Here , and c are parameters of the distribution and and (), () are the cumulative distribution and probability density functions of the standard normal distribution, respectively. The pdf of the ARGUS distribution is a solution of the following differential equation: The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the ARGUS distribution is . Parameter c is assumed to be known (the speed of light), whereas can be estimated from the sample X1, , Xn using the maximum likelihood approach. The estimator is a function of sample second moment, and is given as a solution to the non-linear equation . The solution exists and is unique, provided that the right-hand side is greater than 0.4; the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Sometimes a more general form is used to describe a more peaking-like distribution: where () is the gamma function, and (,) is the upper incomplete gamma function. Here parameters c, , p represent the cutoff, curvature, and power respectively. The mode is: p = 0.5 gives a regular ARGUS, listed above.
