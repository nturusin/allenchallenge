The Cordillera Real is a mountain range in the South American Altiplano of Bolivia. This range of fold mountains, largely composed of granite, is located southeast of Lake Titicaca, and east of the Bolivian capital of La Paz, measuring 125 km in length and 20 km in width. Despite the fact that it is only 17 south of the Equator, the Cordillera Real is relatively densely glaciated.
