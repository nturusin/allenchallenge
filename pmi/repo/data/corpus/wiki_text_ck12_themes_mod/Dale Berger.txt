Dale Berger is a Professor of Psychology and former Dean of the School of Behavioral and Organizational Sciences (SBOS), Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California. Berger is a cognitive psychologist and research methodologist with a focus on the use of technology in support of teaching and learning statistics. Berger is a Fellow of the American Psychological Society (APS) and the Western Psychological Association (WPA), former President of the Western Psychological Association (20022003), and recipient of the 1997 Outstanding Teaching Award from the Western Psychological Association. Berger's statistics website WISE was selected as a winner of the MERLOT Award for Exemplary Online Learning Resources, which recognizes and promotes outstanding online resources designed to enhance teaching and learning. (1) WISE consists of a sequence of interactive tutorials on key statistical concepts, including: sampling distributions (2) the central limit theorem (3) hypothesis testing (4) statistical power (5) correlation and regression analysis (6) t-tests (7) The tutorials use dynamic applets that allow the user to explore relationships on their own. Guided exercises are designed to help the learner to take advantage of the applets to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and logic that underlie much of inferential statistics. Berger received his B.S. in mathematics from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (Phi Beta Kappa), and his MA and Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles.
