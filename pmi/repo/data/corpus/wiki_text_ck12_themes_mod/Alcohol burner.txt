Alcohol burner is a laboratory equipment used to produce open flame. It replaces the use of Bunsen burner in the laboratories due to its safety. The open flame it produces is low in heat with and approximately 2 inches in flame height. There are two types of alcohol burners used in laboratory including aluminum and glass alcohol burner. Alcohol burners do not burn as hot as other types of flame, but they are sufficient for standard molecular biology, they can be used for flame sterilizing laboratory equipment such as inoculating loops and forceps. In addition, they can be used as a heat source to boil small amount of liquid in some laboratory work. Alcohol burner is filled with flammable liquid (class IA) which includes the liquid with less than 37.8 C flash point (e.g. acetone, ethanol, toluene, hexane, carbon disulphide, gasoline, camp stove fuel, kerosene). The flammable liquid is filled in about half of the burner. The bottom end of the wick is soaked in the fuel. For first use, soak the top of the wick with small amount of fuel to prevent it from turning black when catching a fire. Check the fuel spills before lighting. Light the alcohol burner with matches or lighters. Extinguish the flame with the alcohol burner cap and always put the cap on when not in use.
