Aseptatorina is a suborder of parasitic protozoa of the phylum Apicomplexia There are eleven families recognised in this suborder. There are ~400 species in these families. Five families - Allantocystidae, Diplocystidae, Enterocystidae, Ganymedidae and Schaudinnellidae - have only one genus. Aikinetocystidae has two genera. Two families in this suborder - Ganymedidae and Thiriotiidae - infect crustaceans. The taxonomy of this suborder may be in need of revision as it has been shown based on SSU 18S rDNA sequences that four families - Ganymedidae from the Aseptatorina and Cephalolobidae, Porosporidae and Uradiophoridae from the Septatorina appear to form a superfamily. The name Cephaloidophoroidea has been proposed for this superfamily This suborder was created by Chakravarty in 1960. The gamont of the species in this suborder have a single compartment. An epimerite or mucron is found in some species. Syzygy occurs.
