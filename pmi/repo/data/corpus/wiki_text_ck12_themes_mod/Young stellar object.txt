Young stellar object (YSO) denotes a star in its early stage of evolution. This class consists of two groups of objects: protostars and premain-sequence stars. Sometimes they are divided by mass massive YSO (MYSO), intermediate mass YSO and brown dwarfs. YSO are usually classified using criteria based on the slope of their SED, introduced by Lada C.J. in 1987. He proposed three classes (I, II and III), based on the values of intervals of spectral index : . Here is wavelength, and is flux density. The is calculated in the wavelength interval of 2.220 (near- and mid- infrared region). Later Greene et al. in 1994 added a fourth class of "flat spectrum" class sources. In 1993 Andre et al. discovered class 0objects with strong submillimeter emission, but very faint at . Class 0 sources undetectable at Class I sources have Flat spectrum sources have Class II sources have Class III sources have This classification schema roughly reflects evolutionary sequence. It is believed that most deeply embedded Class 0 sources evolve towards Class I stage dissipating their circumstellar envelopes. Eventually they become optically visible on the stellar birthline as premain sequence stars. YSO are also associated with early star evolution phenomena: jets and bipolar outflows, masers, HerbigHaro objects, and protoplanetary disks (circumstellar disks or proplyds).
