Pascal's barrel is the name of a hydrostatics experiment allegedly performed by Blaise Pascal in 1646. In the experiment, Pascal inserted a 10-m long (32.8 ft) vertical tube into a barrel filled with water. When water was poured into the vertical tube, Pascal found that the increase in hydrostatic pressure caused the barrel to burst. The experiment is mentioned nowhere in Pascal's preserved works and it may be apocryphal, attributed to him by 19th-century French authors, among whom the experiment is known as crve-tonneau (approx. : "barrel-buster"); nevertheless the experiment remains associated with Pascal in many elementary physics textbooks.
