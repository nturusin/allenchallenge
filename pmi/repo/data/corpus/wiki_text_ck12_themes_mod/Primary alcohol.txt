A primary alcohol is an alcohol which has the hydroxyl group connected to a primary carbon atom. It can also be defined as a molecule containing a CH2OH group. In contrast, a secondary alcohol has a formula CHROH and a tertiary alcohol has a formula CR2OH, where R indicates a carbon-containing group. Examples of primary alcohols include ethanol and butanol. Some sources include methanol as a primary alcohol, including the 1911 edition of the Encyclopdia Britannica, but this interpretation is less common in modern texts.
