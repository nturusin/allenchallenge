In geometry, the pentagonal orthobirotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J34). It can be constructed by joining two pentagonal rotundae (J6) along their decagonal faces, matching like faces. A Johnson solid is one of 92 strictly convex polyhedra that have regular faces but are not uniform (that is, they are not Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, prisms or antiprisms). They were named by Norman Johnson, who first listed these polyhedra in 1966. The pentagonal orthobirotunda is also related to a Archimedean solid, the icosidodecahedron, which can also be called a pentagonal gyrobirotunda, similarly created by two pentagonal rotunda but with a 36-degree rotation.
