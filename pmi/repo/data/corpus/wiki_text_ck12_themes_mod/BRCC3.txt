Lys-63-specific deubiquitinase BRCC36 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the BRCC3 gene. This gene encodes a subunit of the BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is also thought to be involved in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and progression through the G2/M checkpoint. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. BRCC3 has been shown to interact with BRE, BRCA2, RAD51, BRCA1, P53 and BARD1.
