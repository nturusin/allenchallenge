Integral monotopic proteins, are permanently attached to the membrane from one side. Three-dimensional structures of the following integral monotopic proteins have been determined: prostaglandin H2 syntheses 1 and 2 (cyclooxygenases) lanosterol synthase and squalene-hopene cyclase microsomal prostaglandin E synthase carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 There are also structures of integral monotopic domains of transmembrane proteins: monoamine oxidases A and B fatty acid amide hydrolase mammalian cytochrome P450 oxidases corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenases
