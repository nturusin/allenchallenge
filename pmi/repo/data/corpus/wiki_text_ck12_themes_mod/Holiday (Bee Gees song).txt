"Holiday" is a song released by the Bee Gees. It was not released as a single in their native United Kingdom as Polydor UK released the single "World" from their next album Horizontal, but was released in the United States in September 1967. It appeared on the album Bee Gees' 1st. The song was prominently featured in the Korean films Nowhere to Hide and Holiday. The song is haunting, even eerie, having been composed primarily in a minor key with a strong orchestral presence. Brothers Barry and Robin Gibb who also wrote the song share lead vocals. The song was recorded during the same session as "To Love Somebody" around April 1967. The song's flipside was "Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You" in the US but "Red Chair, Fade Away" was used in other territories. The song's music video, consisted of footage of the band enjoying traveling a city bus in Paris. Their footage visiting Paris is also used as the music video for "Words". Another promotional film, filmed in black and white, featured the group performing the song. The song remained a concert favourite for over 30 years, and Maurice Gibb often provided the audience with comedic antics by attempting many failed attempts to join Barry and Robin while singing this song. Evidence of this can be seen in a 1989 "One for all Tour" concert video where Maurice takes a camera from a film cameraman standing nearby and films Barry and Robin as they sing the song.
