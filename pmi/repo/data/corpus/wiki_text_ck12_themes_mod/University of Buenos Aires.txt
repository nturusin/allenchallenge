The University of Buenos Aires (Spanish: Universidad de Buenos Aires, UBA) is the largest university in Argentina and the second largest university by enrollment in Latin America. Founded on August 12, 1821 in the city of Buenos Aires, it consists of 13 departments, 6 hospitals, 10 museums and is linked to 4 high schools: Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini, Instituto Libre de Segunda Enseanza and Escuela de Educacin Tcnica Profesional en Produccin Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria. Entry to any of the available programmes of study in the university is open to anyone with a secondary school degree; in most cases, students who have successfully completed high school must pass a first year called CBC, which stands for Ciclo Bsico Comn (Common Basic Cycle). Only upon completion of this first year may the student enter the chosen school; until then, they must attend courses in different buildings, and have up to 3 years to finish the 6 or 7 subjects (which vary depending on the programme of study chosen) assigned in two groups of 3 or 4. Each subject is of one semester duration (MarchJuly or AugustNovember). If someone passes all 6 subjects in their respective semester, the CBC will take only one year. Potential students of economics, instead, take a 2-year common cycle, the "CBG" (General Basic Cycle), comprising 12 subjects. The UBA has no central campus. A centralized Ciudad Universitaria (literally, "university city") was started in the 1960s, but contains only two schools, with the others at different locations in Buenos Aires. Access to the university is free of charge for everyone, including foreigners. However, the postgraduate programs charge tuition fees that can be covered with research scholarships for those students with outstanding academic performance. The university has produced four Nobel Prize laureates, one of the most prolific institutions in the Spanish-speaking world. It is currently the best ranked Argentine university in college and university rankings, present at number 197 of the Top Universities 2008 and at number 151-200 of the 2010 Shanghai Jiao Tong University ranking. According to the 2010 University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), the university is the best in Argentina and the 247th in the world, and, according to TopUniversities, it is the 46th best university in the world taking into account employer reputation. The schools that comprise the university are: Ciclo Bsico Comn Facultad de Psicologa (psychology) Facultad de Ingeniera (engineering) Facultad de Odontologa (dentistry) Facultad Farmacia de y Bioqumica (pharmacy and biochemistry) Facultad de Filosofa y Letras (philosophy and literature) Facultad de Derecho (law) Facultad de Medicina (medicine) Facultad de Ciencias Sociales (social sciences) Facultad de Veterinaria (veterinary medicine) Facultad de Agronoma (agronomy) Facultad de Ciencias Econmicas (economics) Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (exact science and natural science) Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseo y Urbanismo (architecture, design and urbanism) Of these, only the last two have their buildings located in Ciudad Universitaria, a campus-like location in Nez, in northern Buenos Aires. The others are scattered around the city in buildings of various sizes, with some having more than one building. There are projects to move more schools to Ciudad Universitaria, the first one in order of importance is the School of Psychology, whose building is already designed to be placed on this Campus.
