Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, Whitaker syndrome, or candidiasis-hypoparathyroidism-Addison's disease-syndrome, is a subtype of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, in which multiple endocrine glands dysfunction as a result of autoimmunity. It is a genetic disorder inherited in autosomal recessive fashion due to a defect in the AIRE (Auto immune regulator) gene which is located on chromosome 21 and normally confers immune tolerance. Its main features include: A mild immune deficiency, leading to persistent mucosal and cutaneous infections with candida yeasts. There is also decreased function of the spleen (hyposplenism). Autoimmune dysfunction of the parathyroid gland (leading to hypocalcaemia) and the adrenal gland (Addison's disease: hypoglycemia, hypotension and severe reactions in disease). Other disease associations are: hypothyroidism hypogonadism and infertility vitiligo (depigmentation of the skin) alopecia (baldness) malabsorption pernicious anemia chronic active (autoimmune) hepatitis It is caused in autosomal recessive manner due to a defect in AIRE gene mapped to 21q22.3.
