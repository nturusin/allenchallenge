The mutual inductance by circuit i on circuit j is given by the double integral Neumann formula where is the magnetic flux through the ith surface by the electrical circuit outlined by Cj Ci is the enclosing curve of Si. B is the magnetic field vector. A is the vector potential. Stokes' theorem has been used. so that the mutual inductance is a purely geometrical quantity independent of the current in the circuits.
