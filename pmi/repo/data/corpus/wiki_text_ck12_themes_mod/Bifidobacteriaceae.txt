Bifidobacteriaceae is the only family of bacteria, in the order of Bifidobacteriales. According to the 16S rRNA-based LTP release 106 published by the All-Species Living Tree Project, the order Bifidobacteriales is a clade nested within the suborder Micrococcineae, also the genus Bifidobacterium is paraphyletic to the other genera within the family, i.e. the other genera are nested within Bifidobacterium. The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 106 by The All-Species Living Tree Project Notes: Strains found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) but not listed in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN)
