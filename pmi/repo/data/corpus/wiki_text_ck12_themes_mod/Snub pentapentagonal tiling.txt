In geometry, the snub pentapentagonal tiling is a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. It has Schlfli symbol of sr{5,5}, constructed from two regular pentagons and three equilateral triangles around every vertex. Drawn in chiral pairs, with edges missing between black triangles: A double symmetry coloring can be constructed from [5,4] symmetry with only one color pentagon. It has Schlfli symbol s{5,4}, and Coxeter diagram .
