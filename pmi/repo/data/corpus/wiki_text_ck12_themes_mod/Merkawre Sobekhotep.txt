Merkawre Sobekhotep (also known as Sobekhotep VII) was the thirty-seventh pharaoh of the 13th dynasty during the second intermediate period. He probably reigned over Middle and perhaps Upper Egypt during the mid-17th century BC from 1664 BC until 1663 BC. Alternatively, the German Egyptologist Thomas Schneider dates this short-lived king's reign from 1646 BC to 1644 BC Merkawre Sobekhotep is attested by a scarab-seal of unknown origin and by two statues dedicated to Amun. The statues were originally from Karnak and are now in the Egyptian Museum and in the Louvre Museum respectively. The statues present Merkawre Sobekhotep with two sons Bebi and Sobekhotep, both bearing the titles of "king's son" and of "court official". Merkawre Sobekhotep is also named in the Turin canon (Ryholt: row 8 column 8, Gardiner & von Beckerath: row 7, column 8) and in the Karnak king list. The Turin canon credits him with a reign of 2 years, a lost number of months and 3 to 4 days. Consequently Ryholt attributes him 2 and a half years of reign. The exact chronological position of Merkawre Sobekhotep in the 13th dynasty is not known for certain owing to uncertainties affecting earlier kings of the dynasty. According to the Turin canon, Merkawre Sobekhotep was the immediate successor of Sewadjkare Hori. Darell Baker makes him the thirty-seventh king of the dynasty, Kim Ryholt sees him as the thirty-eighth king and Jrgen von Beckerath places him as the thirty-second pharaoh of the dynasty. After Merkawre Sobekhotep's kingship, the sequence of rulers of the 13th dynasty is highly uncertain due to a large lacuna affecting the Turin canon. Four to seven king names are lost to the lacuna.
