"The Field Trip" is the first episode of the second series of The Inbetweeners. It first aired on 2 April 2009 on E4. It is a new term and the boys have signed up for the annual Geography and Sociology field trip to Swanage. Although Neil does not take either of the subjects, he is allowed to come along by agreeing to help Mr. Kennedy a geography teacher and alleged paedophile. When the boys are moved from the back seat of the coach by Mark, the school bully, Will gets a stroke of luck when he gets to sit next to new girl Lauren. The two get on well and Will falls for her, but Lauren unfortunately has her eyes set on Simon. Will's constant Yoda impressions are not helping either. The boys arrive in Swanage, and as Will and Simon both attempt to woo Lauren, Neil and Jay set off to find the legendary "Swanage MILF" that allegedly has sex with one pupil every year. Simon realises that he still loves childhood friend Carli and Will takes the opportunity to invite Lauren on a boat trip. Neil and Jay fail to find the MILF and, along with Simon, they crash the boat trip. As Lauren has not yet arrived, Will agrees to take them out for a short sail. After a number of unfortunate incidents on the boat, such as Simon falling into the harbour and being undressed by Neil and the boys being "attacked" by a fish (which Neil beats to death with his bare fist- as it would no longer be able to survive in water), Jay sets off an emergency flare and the boys are saved, albeit at the expense of looking like idiots to the rest of the field trip party. First appearance of Mr Kennedy. The episode was not filmed in Swanage. It was filmed in Littlehampton and St Albans.
