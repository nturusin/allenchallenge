Con Conrad (June 18, 1891 September 28, 1938) was an American songwriter and producer. Con Conrad was born Conrad K. Dober in New York City. He published his first song, "Down in Dear Old New Orleans", in 1912. Conrad produced the Broadway show The Honeymoon Express, starring Al Jolson, in 1913. By 1918, Conrad was writing and publishing with Henry Waterson and had his first major hit in 1920 with the song Margie. Over the next several years, he would also be responsible for such standards as "Ma! He's Making Eyes at Me", "You've Got to See Your Mama Every Night", "Memory Lane", "Lonesome and Sorry", "Palesteena" and "Come on Spark Plug". In 1923 Conrad focused on the stage and wrote the scores for the Broadway shows: The Greenwich Village Follies, Moonlight, Betty Lee, Kittys Kisses and Americana. In 1924 the Longacre Theatre staged the small musical Moonlight, with a score by Conrad and William B. Friedlander. The next year Conrad and Friedlander's Mercenary Mary was presented at the Longacre. In 1929 Conrad moved to Hollywood after losing all of his money on unsuccessful shows. There he worked on films such as: Fox Movietone Follies, Palmy Days, The Gay Divorcee and Heres to Romance.
