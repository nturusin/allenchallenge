Perseus Books Group is an American publishing company founded in 1996 by investor Frank Pearl. It was named Publisher of the Year in 2007 by Publishers Weekly magazine for its role in taking on publishers formerly distributed by Publishers Group West and acquiring Avalon Publishing Group. In January 2007, Perseus Book Group purchased Avalon Publishing Group, the parent company of Carroll & Graf and Thunder's Mouth Press; the purchaser folded both imprints and stopped publishing books under those names in May 2007. The Perseus Books Group currently has 12 imprints: Before Avalon Publishing Group was integrated into the Perseus Books Group, it published on 14 imprint presses. In 2007, some of these imprints were integrated into the Perseus Books Group, while others folded or were sold to other companies. Perseus also sold one of their imprints in the restructuring process. = Avalon Travel Publishing Axoplasm Black Square Editions Blue Moon Books Carroll & Graf Publishers acquired in 1998, folded in 2007 Four Walls Eight Windows absorbed into Thunder's Mouth Press in 2004 Marlowe & Company absorbed into the DaCapo imprint No Exit Press Seal Press Shoemaker & Hoard Publishers sold to Counterpoint LLC Thunder's Mouth Press folded in 2007 = Counterpoint Press sold to Counterpoint LLC In addition, Perseus owns separate book distribution companies.
