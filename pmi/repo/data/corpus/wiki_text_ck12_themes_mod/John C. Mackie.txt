Mackie was quoted as being critical of the increasing popularity of compact cars, saying, "They may be socially desirable in some parts of the country, but I think they are a nuisance. If they really take holdand I don't think they willthen it is inevitable that gas and weight taxes will have to go up, both for the federal and state government."

Romney, then the president of American Motors Corporation and leading proponent of compact cars in the United States.
