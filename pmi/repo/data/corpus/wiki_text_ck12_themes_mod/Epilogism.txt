Epilogism is a style of Inference invented by the ancient Empiric school of medicine. It is a theory-free method of looking at history by accumulating fact with minimal generalization and being conscious of the side effects of making causal claims (See also Causal inference). Epilogism is an inference which moves entirely within the domain of visible and evident things, it tries not to invoke unobservables. It is tightly knit to the famous "tripos of medicine". See also Doctrines of the Empiric school. Epilogism is discussed as a way of viewing history in The Black Swan (Taleb book) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
