Wolfgang "Wolf" Helmut Berger (born 5 October 1937, Erlangen) is a German-American oceanographer, geologist, micropaleontologist and emeritus professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego. His research interests comprise "micropaleontology, marine sedimentation, ocean productivity, carbon cycle, ocean history, climate history, and history of oceanography." Berger earned in 1961 his Vordiplom degree in geology at the University of Erlangen and in 1963 his master's degree in geology at the University of Colorado in Boulder. In 1968 he received his PhD in oceanography from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). From 1968 to 1970 he did research at the UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and in 1970/1971 he was an Assistant at the Geological Institute of the University of Kiel. In 1971 he became an assistant professor, in 1974 an associate professor, and then in 1981 a professor at the Scripps Institution, where he was in 1996/1997 the interim director. In 1997 Berger became the director of the California Space Institute in San Diego. In 1977 and in 1980 he was a visiting professor at the University of Kiel. In 1987 he did research at the University of Bremen. His research is especially concerned with the ecology of planktonic foraminifera and the reconstruction of the climate and the marine environment of the Cenozoic. Berger is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, and the Geological Society of America. 1979 Bigelow Medal, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute 1980 Norwegian Research Fellow 1984 Huntsman Award, Bedford Institute of Oceanography 1986 Lady Davis Fellow, Hebrew University 1986 Humboldt Award, presented in Bonn 1988 Maurice Ewing Medal, presented in San Francisco 1991 Prince Albert I Medal, presented in Paris 1993 Balzan Prize, presented in Bern 1998 Gustav-Steinmann-Medaille, presented in Bern 2001 Foreign Member, Academia Europaea Berger, W.
