In human geography, a catchment area is the area from which a city, service or institution attracts a population that use their services. For example, a school catchment area is the geographic area from which students are eligible to attend a local school. Governments and community service organizations often define catchment areas for planning purposes and public safety such as ensuring universal access to services like fire departments, police departments, ambulance bases and hospitals. Catchment areas are generally established and modified by local governments. These boundaries can be modeled using geographic information systems (GIS). There can be large variability in the services provided within different catchments in the same area depending upon how and when those catchments were established. They are usually contiguaous but can overlap when they describe competing services. Catchments can be defined based upon a number of factors including distance to the facility, actual travel time to the facility, geographic boundaries or population within the catchment. In a distance based catchment, the area serviced will often depend on the number of visits expected to that institution by each individual. For example, it may be more acceptable to have a larger catchment for a hospital where any one individual will have few annual visits in comparison to a school where visits will be daily and hence desired distance would be closer. When a facilitys capacity can only service a certain volume, the catchment may be used to limit a populations ability to access services outside of that area. For example, children may be unable to enroll in a school outside of their catchment to prevent the school's services being exceeded. Airports can be built and maintained in locations which minimize the driving distance for the surrounding population to reach them. A neighborhood or district of a city often has several small convenience shops, each with a catchment area of several streets. Supermarkets, on the other hand, have a much lower density, with catchment areas of several neighborhoods (or several villages in rural areas). This principle, similar to the central place theory, makes catchment areas an important area of study for geographers, economists, and urban planners. In Nigeria most Federal Schools respect the fact that some states are educationally less developed than others. The country's higher education catchment areas have therefore been designed to ensure a good mixture of students from different backgrounds.
