This timeline lists the dates of the first women's suffrage in Muslim majority countries. Dates for the right to vote, suffrage, as distinct from the right to stand for election and hold office, are listed. Some dates relate to regional elections and where possible the second date of general election has been included. Even countries listed may not have universal suffrage for women, and some may have regressed in women's rights since the initial granting of suffrage. It should be mentioned that for many of the nations listed below, the seeming "belatedness" of women's suffrage (relative to many European and North American nations) did not derive from Islamic politics, but rather from the fact that most of these nations were colonies of European empires for much of the twentieth century and thus had no suffrage until winning national independence. Often national independence and woman's suffrage occurred simultaneously. 1917 - Crimean People's Republic 1918 - Azerbaijan Democratic Republic; Kyrgyzstan 1920 - Albania 1921 - Azerbaijan 1924 - Tajikistan, Kazakhstan 1927 - Turkmenistan 1930 - Turkey 1932 - Maldives 1938 - Uzbekistan 1945 - Indonesia, Senegal 1946 - British Palestine 1947-(Since Independence) - Pakistan 1948 - Niger 1949-1953 - Syria 1952 - Lebanon (An educational requirement was dropped in 1957). 1956 - Comoros, Egypt, Mali, Mauritania, Somalia 1957 - Malaysia 1959 - Tunisia 1960 - Gambia 1961 - Sierra Leone 1962 - Algeria 1963 - Iran, Morocco 1964 - Libya, Sudan 1965 - Afghanistan 1970 - Yemen 1972 - Bangladesh 1973 - Bahrain 1974 - Jordan 1978 - Nigeria 1980 - Iraq 1985 - Kuwait (female suffrage later removed, re-granted in 2005) 1993-1994 - Kazakhstan (re-confirmed the right that already existed before independence) 1994 - Oman 1999 - Qatar 2006 - United Arab Emirates 2015 - Saudi Arabia Brunei has had no suffrage for men or women since 1965 due to a continued declared state of emergency.
