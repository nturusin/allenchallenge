In mathematics, a half-exponential function is a function so that if is composed with itself the result is exponential: Another definition is that is half-exponential if it is non-decreasing and 1(xC) o(log x). for every C > 0. It has been proven that every function composed of basic arithmetic operations, exponentials, and logarithms, then ((x)) is either subexponential or superexponential: half-exponential functions are not expressible in terms of elementary functions. There are infinitely many functions whose self-composition is the same exponential function as each other. In particular, for every in the open interval and for every continuous strictly increasing function g from onto , there is an extension of this function to a continuous monotonic function on the real numbers such that . In particular, Half-exponential functions are used in computational complexity theory for growth rates "intermediate" between polynomial and exponential.
