The UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) covers internationally designated protected areas, each known as biosphere reserves, that are meant to demonstrate a balanced relationship between people and nature (e.g. encourage sustainable development). The World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) of the MAB Programme consists of a dynamic and interactive network of sites. It works to foster the harmonious integration of people and nature for sustainable development through participatory dialogue, knowledge sharing, poverty reduction, human well-being improvements, respect for cultural values and by improving societys ability to cope with climate change. It promotes North-South and South-South collaboration and represents a unique tool for international cooperation through the exchange of experiences and know-how, capacity-building and the promotion of best practices. As of 2015 total membership has reached 651 biosphere reserves, including 15 transboundary sites, in 120 countries occurring in all regions of the world. Myanmar had its first biosphere reserve inscribed this year(2015).This already takes into account some biosphere reserves that have been withdrawn or revised through the years, as the programs focus has shifted from simple protection of nature to areas displaying close interaction between man and environment. 1 Includes the Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean, shared between Morocco and Spain* Source - UNESCO, 2012
