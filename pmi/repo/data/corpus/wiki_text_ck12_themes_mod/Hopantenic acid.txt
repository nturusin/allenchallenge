Hopantenic acid (homopantothenic acid), also known as N-pantoyl-GABA, is a central nervous system depressant. Formulated as the calcium salt, it is used in the Russian Federation for a variety of neurological, psychological and psychiatric conditions and sold as Pantogam (Russian: ). Hopantenic acid is a homologue of pantothenic acid. While pantothenic acid is the amide of D-pantoate and -alanine, hopantenic acid is the amide of D-pantoate and -aminobutyric acid (GABA). This change leads to an additional CH2 in the molecule.
