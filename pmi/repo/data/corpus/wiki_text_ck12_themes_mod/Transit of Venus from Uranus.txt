A transit of Venus across the Sun as seen from Uranus takes place when the planet Venus passes directly between the Sun and Uranus, obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Uranus. During a transit, Venus can be seen from Uranus as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. Naturally, no one has ever seen a transit of Venus from Uranus, nor is this likely to happen in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the next one will take place on September 22, 2028. A transit could be observed from the surface of one of Uranus' moons rather than from Uranus itself. The times and circumstances of the transits would naturally be slightly different. The Venus-Uranus synodic period is 226.347 days. It can be calculated using the formula 1/(1/P-1/Q), where P is the sidereal orbital period of Venus (224.695 days) and Q is the orbital period of Uranus (30,799.095 days). Transits of Venus from Uranus are empirically observed to occur in clusters, with two such clusters every 40 years or so.
