The Kent Invicta Football League is a football league in England, formed in 2011 to commence operations for the 201112 season. It covers the traditional English county of Kent, some of which is now in Greater London. Negotiations to form a new Step 6 (level 10 in the overall English football league system) division began in 2009 to make promotion and relegation between the Kent League (Step 5, now Southern Counties East Football League) and Kent County League (Step 7) easier, as there had not been a relegation to the Kent County League for a number of seasons and promotions had been infrequent. The league also organises a knockout competition, the Challenge Trophy.
