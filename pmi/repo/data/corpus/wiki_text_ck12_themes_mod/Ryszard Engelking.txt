Ryszard Engelking (born 1935 in Sosnowiec) is a Polish mathematician. He was working mainly on general topology and dimension theory. He is author of several influential monographs in this field. The 1989 edition of his General Topology is nowadays a standard reference for Topology. Apart from his books, Ryszard Engelking is known, among other things, for a generalization to an arbitrary topological space of the "Alexandroff double circle", for works on completely metrizable spaces, suborderable spaces and generalized ordered spaces. The Engelking-Karlowicz theorem is a statement about the existence of a family of functions from to with topological and set-theoretical applications. In addition to research papers authored just by himself, he also published jointly with Kazimierz Kuratowski, Roman Sikorski, Aleksander Peczyski and others. He has published about 60 scientific works reviewed by MathSciNet and Zentralblatt. Apart from mathematics he is also interested in literature. He translated into Polish French authors: Flaubert's Madame Bovary , and works of Baudelaire, Grard de Nerval, Auguste de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne. For these activities he was awarded by Literatura na wiecie (World Literature). R. Engelking (1968). Outline of General Topology. translated from Polish. North-Holland, Amsterdam. R.
