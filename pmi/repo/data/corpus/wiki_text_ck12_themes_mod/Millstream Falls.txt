The Millstream Falls (Aboriginal: Yindinji), a tiered plunge waterfall on The Millstream, is located in the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Wet Tropics in the Far North region of Queensland, Australia. The Millstream Falls are situated approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) southwest of Ravenshoe, on the Atherton Tableland and are accessible by road from the Kennedy Highway. The falls are protected within the Millstream Falls National Park. The falls comprise two sets of falls, Big Millstream Falls and Little Millstream Falls, both located on the same watercourse, situated approximately 500 metres (1,600 ft) apart. The larger of the two falls is reputably the widest single-drop waterfall in Australia.
