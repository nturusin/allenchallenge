The CIA World Factbook states that 30% of the population is Christian with Muslims being 35% and 35% practicing indigenous beliefs, though it is uncertain how up-to-date these figures are. A 2010 Pew survey found 61.4 percent of respondents to be Christian, 35.2 percent to be Muslim, 1.8 percent to follow traditional African religions, 1.4 percent to be unaffiliated, and 0.1 percent to be Hindu. A 2008-09 Pew survey found that 51 percent of Tanzanian Christians described themselves as Catholic, and 44 percent described themselves as Protestant. Among Protestants, Lutherans (13 percent of Tanzanian Christians), Pentecostals (10 percent), Anglicans (10 percent), and adherents of African initiated churches (5 percent) dominate.
