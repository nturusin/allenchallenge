The CONCACAF U-17 Championship is an international association football event in the North America, Central America and the Caribbean region, and is the qualification tournament for the FIFA U-17 World Cup. In 2009 the tournament returned to a championship format in which all four semifinalists qualify to the FIFA U-17 World Cup. The 2009 tournament was cut short due to the swine flu outbreak in Mexico. No championship round was played as a result of the cancellation, and the tournament ended with four teams qualifying to the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup without determining a regional champion. Until 1988 the tournament was held as a Under 16 edition. Note: no titles or runners-up between 1999 and 2007. Number of FIFA U-17 World Cup qualifications by country.
