Members of parliament tend to form parliamentary groups (also called parliamentary parties) with members of the same political party.

To become an MP, a person must be entitled to vote (i.e. be a Swedish citizen, be at least 18 years old and be or have been resident in Sweden) and must be nominated by a political party. The MPs are elected by proportionality in constituencies across the nation. To decide which candidate will be elected the modified Sainte-Lagu method is used. This method usually but not always gives an accurate result in proportion to cast votes. In the 2014 general election the center-right collation government got one less MP than the overall opposition, in despite of more votes in total. To be elected you must be resident in the constituency which you represent. To get a more proportional result 39 MPs are elected at compensation mandate (Utjmningsmandat) and those MPs therefore doesn't represent their own constituency.
