Oxotremorine is a parasympathomimetic drug that acts as a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. Oxotremorine produces ataxia, tremor and spasticity, similar to those symptoms seen in Parkinsonism, and has thus become a research tool in experimental studies aimed at determining more effective anti-Parkinsonian drugs. Oxotremorine produces also antipsychotic effects.
