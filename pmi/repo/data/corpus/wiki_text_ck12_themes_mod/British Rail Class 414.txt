The British Rail Class 414 (or 2-HAP) were 2-car electric multiple units that were built between 1956 and 1963. They were withdrawn in 1995. The class formed part of the Southern Region's express fleet, and were fitted with the standard 90mph express gear ratio, for such units. This was primarily because a number of their duties, involved working in multiple with the 4-CEP Express fleet, also of 90mph maximum speed. Three batches (209 units) were built. The first batch of thirty-six units were built on the reclaimed underframes of older 2-NOL units, to the old SR-style Bulleid design and numbered in the range 56015636. These units had the formation Driving Motor Brake Open Second (DMBSO) + Driving Trailer Composite with lavatory (DTCK). In the 1970s, the first class seating was downgraded in the DTCKL, becoming DTSK. The units were then reclassified as class 418/0 2-SAP. All were withdrawn by 1982, with the DMBSO getting refurbished and integrated into the class 415 refurbishment programme. The DTSKs were scrapped. The second and third batches of units, numbered 60016049 and 60506173 respectively, were formed DMBSO + DTCsoL, as opposed to the earlier DTCK, and were built to the newer standard Mark 1 coach profile. Again in the 1970s, several of these later units had their first class accommodation downgraded to second class. They were also reclassified as 418 2-SAP and renumbered 59015951. They were converted back to their original configuration by 1982 when many of these two later batches of units got reformed to class 413/2 and 413/3 4-CAP units. In compliance with the TOPS numbering system, surviving units from the range 60016049 got renumbered into the 42xx series (class 414/2); the surviving units of 60506173 became 43xx (class 414/3). Withdrawals of the class began in 1982 and modernisation of the units began in 1983, when 10 DMBSO from withdrawn units were converted for use on the Gatwick Express service in conjunction with converted loco-hauled Open First (FO) and Open Second (SO) vehicles and class 73 locomotives. These vehicles were classified as 489 with "units" numbered 91019110 and individual carriage numbers 6850068509. On 16 November 1970, a unit of the class was derailed at London Bridge. On 26 February 1971, a train formed by five units of the class overran the buffers at Sheerness-on-Sea, Kent. One person was killed and ten were injured. Two units have been preserved:
