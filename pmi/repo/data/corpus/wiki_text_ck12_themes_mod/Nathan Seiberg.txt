Nathan "Nati" Seiberg (/sabr/; born September 22, 1956) is an Israeli American theoretical physicist who works on string theory. He is currently a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. His contributions to mathematical physics include: Mathematical foundations of rational 2-dimensional CFTs (with G. Moore). Discovery of some of the first examples of "Seiberg Duals", numerous and ever growing disparate theories that are dynamically equivalent to another at low energy papers from the early 1990s about the application of holomorphy to calculations in gauge theories with supersymmetry, including a solution of N=1 four-dimensional gauge theories such as SQCD. He later used renormalization group methods to obtain a 3d Seiberg dual for his 4D SQCD articles about the strong-weak duality (S-duality) in the context of supersymmetric gauge theories papers about the complete solution of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four and three dimensions a paper on Matrix theory and M theory in the discrete Light-Cone Quantization his and Edward Witten's analysis of the appearance of non-commutative geometry in theories containing open strings, and an identification of a low energy limit of open string dynamics as a noncommutative quantum field theory OM-theory (with Andrew Strominger and Shiraz Minwalla) He was recipient of a 1996 MacArthur Fellowship and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics in 1998. In July 2012, he was an inaugural awardee of the Fundamental Physics Prize, the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, Yuri Milner.
