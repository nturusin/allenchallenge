Note that there exists a category for proteins that is more complete than this list. A list of proteins (and protein complexes). This list aims to organize information on the protein universe. All proteins can be found in the human proteome unless marked with a "%". If a protein has an EC number, it should be on List of enzymes and not on this page, even if it fits into one of the categories below. For more information about categorizing protein types, see List of types of proteins. Actin Arp2/3 coronin Dystrophin FtsZ Keratin Collagen Elastin F-spondin Pikachurin Fibronectin Serum Amyloid P Component Serum albumin = Complement proteins C1-inhibitor C3-convertase Factor VIII Factor XIII Protein C Protein S Protein Z Protein Z-related protease inhibitor Thrombin Von Willebrand Factor = C-reactive protein Hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) Cadherin Ependymin Integrin NCAM Selectin Ion pumping enzymes are in the enzymes section. CFTR Glycophorin D Scramblase = Ligand-gated ion channels Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor GABAa receptors Voltage-gated ion channels Potassium channels Calcium channels Sodium channels = Glucose transporter Growth factors Epidermal growth factor (EGF) Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Peptide hormones Insulin Insulin-like growth factor Oxytocin Steroid hormones Sex steroids Androgens Estrogens Progesterones Receptors with enzyme activity are in the enzymes section. Receptors that are ion channels are in the ion channel section. = G-protein-coupled receptor Rhodopsin = Estrogen receptor Histones Protamines = CI protein % Transcription regulatory proteins that are receptors are in the receptors section.
