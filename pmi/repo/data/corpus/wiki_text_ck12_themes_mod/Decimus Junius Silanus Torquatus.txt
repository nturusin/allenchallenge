Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus (16 AD-64 AD) was a Roman noble who lived in the Roman Empire during the 1st century. He served as a consul in 53. Decimus was the second born son and was among the child born to Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a member of the Junii Silani, a family of Ancient Rome. His maternal grandparents were the princess Julia the Younger and consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. Through his maternal grandparents he was a descendant of Roman Emperor Augustus, noble woman Scribonia, statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and consul Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Decimus allegedly boasted of his descent from Augustus, and as a result Roman Emperor Nero forced him to commit suicide. Decimus married Julia Africana in 54 AD. Julia was the daughter of consul Marcus Julius Africanus. Decimus had one daughter by Julia, named Junia Silana Torquata (b. 55).
