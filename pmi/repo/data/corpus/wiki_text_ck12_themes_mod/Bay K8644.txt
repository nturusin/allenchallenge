Bay K8644 is a chemical compound that functions as a calcium channel agonist. Bay K8644 is used primarily as a biochemical research tool for this effect. It is a structural analog of nifedipine with positive inotropic activity, and as an aromatic it is highly lipid soluble. Bay K8644 targets Voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine (DHP) Calcium Channels (L-Type). It is the first positive inotropic agent shown to act specifically and directly on calcium channels.
