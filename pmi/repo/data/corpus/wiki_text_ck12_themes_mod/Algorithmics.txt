Algorithmics is the science of algorithms. It includes algorithm design, the art of building a procedure which can solve efficiently a specific problem or a class of problem, algorithmic complexity theory, the study of estimating the hardness of problems by studying the properties of algorithm that solves them, or algorithm analysis, the science of studying the properties of a problem, such as quantifying resources in time and memory space needed by this algorithm to solve this problem.
