The becquerel (symbol Bq) (pronounced: /bkrl/ BEK--rel) is the SI derived unit of radioactivity. One Bq is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second. The Bq unit is therefore equivalent to an inverse second, s1. The becquerel is named after Henri Becquerel, who shared a Nobel Prize with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie in 1903 for their work in discovering radioactivity. 1 Bq = 1 s1 A special name was introduced for the reciprocal second (s1) to represent radioactivity to avoid potentially dangerous mistakes with prefixes. For example, 1 s1 could be taken to mean 106 disintegrations per second: 1(106 s)1 = 106 s1. Other names considered were hertz (Hz), a special name already in use for the reciprocal second, and fourier (Fr). The hertz is now only used for periodic phenomena. Whereas 1 Hz is 1 cycle per second, 1 Bq is 1 aperiodic radioactivity event per second. This SI unit is named after Henri Becquerel. As with every International System of Units (SI) unit named for a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (Bq). However, when an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower case letter (becquerel)except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case. Note that "degree Celsius" conforms to this rule because the "d" is lowercase. Based on The International System of Units, section 5.2. Like any SI unit, Bq can be prefixed; commonly used multiples are kBq (kilobecquerel, 103 Bq), MBq (megabecquerel, 106 Bq), GBq (gigabecquerel, 109 Bq), TBq (terabecquerel, 1012 Bq), and PBq (petabecquerel, 1015 Bq). For practical applications, 1 Bq is a small unit; therefore, the prefixes are common. For example, the roughly 0.0169 g of potassium-40 present in a typical human body produces approximately 266,000 disintegrations per minute, which equates to about 4,400 disintegrations per second or 4.4 kBq of activity. The global inventory of carbon-14 is estimated to be 70188500000000000008.51018 Bq (8.5 EBq, 8.5 exabecquerel). The nuclear explosion in Hiroshima (14 kt or 59 TJ) is estimated to have produced 702480000000000000081024 Bq (8 YBq, 8 yottabecquerel). The becquerel succeeded the curie (Ci), an older, non-SI unit of radioactivity based on the activity of 1 gram of radium-226. The curie is defined as 3.71010 s1, or 37 GBq. Conversion factors: 1 Ci = 70103700000000000003.71010 Bq = 37 GBq 1 Ci = 37,000 Bq = 37 kBq 1 Bq = 69999990000000000002.71011 Ci = 69999990000000000002.7105 Ci 1 GBq = 0.027 Ci For a given mass (in grams) of an isotope with atomic mass (in g/mol) and a half-life of (in s), the amount of radioactivity can be calculated using: With =6.022 141 79(30)1023 mol1, the Avogadro constant. Since m/ma is the number of mols (n), the amount of radioactivity can be calculated by: For instance, one gram of potassium contains 0.000117 gram of 40K (all other naturally occurring isotopes are stable) that has a of 70164029905520000001.277109 years = 70164030000000000004.0301016 s, and has an atomic mass of 39.964 g/mol, so the radioactivity is 30 Bq.
