In chemistry, the term supramolecular chirality is used to describe supramolecular assemblies that are non-superposable on their mirror images. Chirality in supramolecular chemistry implies the non-symmetric arrangement of molecular components in a non-covalent assembly. Chirality may arise in a supramolecular system if one of its component is chiral or if achiral components arrange in a non symmetrical way to produce a supermolecule that is chiral. Important examples of the latter case have been reported by Jean-Marie Lehn. [1]
