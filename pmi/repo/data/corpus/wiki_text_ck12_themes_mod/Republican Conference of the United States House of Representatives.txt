The House Republican Conference is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives. It hosts meetings and is the primary forum for communicating the party's message to members. In addition to promoting fiscal responsibility and national security, it produces a daily publication of political analysis under the title Legislative Digest. The conference has a chairman who directs day-to-day operations and who is assisted by an elected vice-chairman and a secretary. In the 112th Congress, the chair was Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Vice Chair was Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, and Secretary was John Carter of Texas. For the 113th Congress (2013-2015), the party elected Cathy McMorris Rodgers as the Chair after a tough fight with conservative Tom Price of Georgia. They also elected Lynn Jenkins of Kansas to the position of Vice Chair and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina to the position of Secretary. Former chairs include John Boehner, Mike Pence, John B. Anderson, Dick Cheney, Jack Kemp, J. C. Watts, Jr. Deborah D. Pryce, and Adam Putnam.
