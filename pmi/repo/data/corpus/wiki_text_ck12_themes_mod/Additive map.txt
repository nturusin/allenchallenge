In algebra an additive map, Z-linear map or additive function is a function that preserves the addition operation: for any two elements x and y in the domain. For example, any linear map is additive. When the domain is the real numbers, this is Cauchy's functional equation. For a specific case of this definition, see additive polynomial. Any homomorphism f between abelian groups is additive by this definition. More formally, an additive map of ring into ring is a homomorphism of the additive group of into the additive group of . An additive map is not required to preserve the product operation of the ring. If and are additive maps, then the map (defined pointwise) is additive. Let be a division ring of characteristic . We can represent an additive map of the division ring as We assume a sum over the index . The number of items depends on the function . The expressions are called the components of the additive map.
