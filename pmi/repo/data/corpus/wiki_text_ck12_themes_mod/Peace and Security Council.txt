The Peace and Security Council is the organ of the African Union in charge of enforcing union decisions. It is patterned somewhat after the United Nations Security Council. Members are elected by the Assembly of the African Union so as to reflect regional balance within Africa, as well as a variety of other criteria, including capacity to contribute militarily and financially to the union, political will to do so, and effective diplomatic presence at Addis Ababa. The council is composed of fifteen countries, of which five are elected to three-year terms, and ten to two-year terms. Countries are immediately re-eligible upon the expiration of their terms. The African Standby Force is an associated military programme. As of April 2014, the fifteen members of the PSC are: Algeria Burundi Chad Ethiopia Equatorial Guinea Gambia Guinea Libya Mozambique Namibia Niger Nigeria South Africa Tanzania Uganda
