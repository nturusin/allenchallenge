In the mathematical field of knot theory, the crosscap number of a knot K is the minimum of taken over all compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces S bounding K; here is the Euler characteristic. The crosscap number of the unknot is zero, as the Euler characteristic of the disk is one. The crosscap number of the trefoil knot is 1, as it bounds a Mbius strip and is not trivial. The crosscap number of a torus knot was determined by M. Teragaito. The formula for the knot sum is
