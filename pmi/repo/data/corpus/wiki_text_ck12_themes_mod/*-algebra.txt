In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, a *-algebra (or involutive algebra) is a mathematical structure consisting of two involutive rings R and A, where R is commutative and A has the structure of an associative algebra over R. Involutive algebras generalize the idea of a number system equipped with conjugation, for example the complex numbers and complex conjugation, matrices over the complex numbers and conjugate transpose, and linear operators over a Hilbert space and Hermitian adjoints. In mathematics, a *-ring is a ring with a map * : A A that is an antiautomorphism and an involution. More precisely, * is required to satisfy the following properties: (x + y)* = x* + y* (xy)* = y*x* 1* = 1 (x*)* = x for all x,y in A. This is also called an involutive ring, involutory ring, and ring with involution. Note that the third axiom is actually redundant, because the second and fourth axioms imply 1* is also a multiplicative identity, and identities are unique. Elements such that x* = x are called self-adjoint. Archetypical examples of a *-ring are fields of complex numbers and algebraic numbers with complex conjugation as the involution. One can define a sesquilinear form over any *-ring. Also, one can define *-versions of algebraic objects, such as ideal and subring, with the requirement to be *-invariant: x I x* I and so on. A *-algebra A is a *-ring, with involution * that is an associative algebra over a commutative *-ring R with involution , such that (rx)* = rx* r R, x A. The base *-ring is usually the complex numbers (with acting as complex conjugation) and is commutative with A such that A is both left and right algebra. Since R is central in A, that is, rx = xr r R, x A the * on A is conjugate-linear in R, meaning (x + y)* = x* + y* for , R, x,y A. A *-homomorphism f : A B is an algebra homomorphism that is compatible with the involutions of A and B, i.e., f(a*) = f(a)* for all a in A. The *-operation on a *-ring is analogous to complex conjugation on the complex numbers. The *-operation on a *-algebra is analogous to taking adjoints in GLn(C). The * involution is a unary operation written with a postfixed star glyph centered above or near the mean line: x x*, or x x (TeX: x^*), but not as "x"; see the asterisk article for details. Any commutative ring becomes a *-ring with the trivial (identical) involution. The most familiar example of a *-ring and a *-algebra over reals is the field of complex numbers C where * is just complex conjugation. More generally, a field extension made by adjunction of a square root (such as the imaginary unit 1) is a *-algebra over the original field, considered as a trivially-*-ring. The * flips the sign of that square root. A quadratic integer ring (for some D) is a commutative *-ring with the * defined in the similar way; quadratic fields are *-algebras over appropriate quadratic integer rings. Quaternions, split-complex numbers, dual numbers, and possibly other hypercomplex number systems form *-rings (with their built-in conjugation operation) and *-algebras over reals (where * is trivial). Note that neither of the three is a complex algebra. Hurwitz quaternions form a non-commutative *-ring with the quaternion conjugation. The matrix algebra of nn matrices over R with * given by the transposition. The matrix algebra of nn matrices over C with * given by the conjugate transpose. Its generalization, the Hermitian adjoint in the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space also defines a *-algebra. The polynomial ring R[x] over a commutative trivially-*-ring R is a *-algebra over R with P*(x) = P(x). If (A,+,,*) is simultaneously a *-ring, an algebra over a ring R (commutative), and (rx)* = r(x*) r R, x A, then A is a *-algebra over R (where * is trivial). As a partial case, any *-ring is a *-algebra over integers. Any commutative *-ring is a *-algebra over itself and, more generally, over any its *-subring. For a commutative *-ring R, its quotient by any its *-ideal is a *-algebra over R. For example, any commutative trivially-*-ring is a *-algebra over its dual numbers ring, a *-ring with non-trivial *, because the quotient by = 0 makes the original ring. The same about a commutative ring K and its polynomial ring K[x]: the quotient by x = 0 restores K. In Hecke algebra, an involution is important to the KazhdanLusztig polynomial. The endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve becomes a *-algebra over the integers, where the involution is given by taking the dual isogeny. A similar construction works for abelian varieties with a polarization, in which case it is called the Rosati involution (see Milne's lecture notes on abelian varieties). Involutive Hopf algebras are important examples of *-algebras (with the additional structure of a compatible comultiplication); the most familiar example being: The group Hopf algebra: a group ring, with involution given by g g1. Many properties of the transpose hold for general *-algebras: The Hermitian elements form a Jordan algebra; The skew Hermitian elements form a Lie algebra; If 2 is invertible in the *-ring, then 1/2(1 + *) and 1/2(1 *) are orthogonal idempotents, called symmetrizing and anti-symmetrizing, so the algebra decomposes as a direct sum of modules (vector spaces if the *-ring is a field) of symmetric and anti-symmetric (Hermitian and skew Hermitian) elements. These spaces do not, generally, form associative algebras, because the idempotents are operators, not elements of the algebra. Given a *-ring, there is also the map * : x x*. It does not define a *-ring structure (unless the characteristic is 2, in which case * is identical to the original *), as 1 1, neither is it antimultiplicative, but it satisfies the other axioms (linear, involution) and hence is quite similar to *-algebra where x x*. Elements fixed by this map (i.e., such that a = a*) are called skew Hermitian. For the complex numbers with complex conjugation, the real numbers are the Hermitian elements, and the imaginary numbers are the skew Hermitian.
