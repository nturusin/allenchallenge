In statistics, the PhillipsPerron test (named after Peter C. B. Phillips and Pierre Perron) is a unit root test. That is, it is used in time series analysis to test the null hypothesis that a time series is integrated of order 1. It builds on the DickeyFuller test of the null hypothesis in , where is the first difference operator. Like the augmented DickeyFuller test, the PhillipsPerron test addresses the issue that the process generating data for might have a higher order of autocorrelation than is admitted in the test equationmaking endogenous and thus invalidating the DickeyFuller t-test. Whilst the augmented DickeyFuller test addresses this issue by introducing lags of as regressors in the test equation, the PhillipsPerron test makes a non-parametric correction to the t-test statistic. The test is robust with respect to unspecified autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the disturbance process of the test equation. Davidson and MacKinnon (2004) report that the PhillipsPerron test performs worse in finite samples than the augmented DickeyFuller test.
