There are fourteen vice-presidents of the European Parliament who sit in for the president in presiding over the plenary of the European Parliament. Vice-presidents are members of the Bureau and chair the plenary when the president is not in the chair. The president may also delegate any duty, task or power to one of the vice-presidents. Three vice-presidents, designated by the Conference of presidents, traditionally have more power than the others; the right to be on the conciliation committee. The vice-presidents are elected following the election of the president, which takes place every two and a half years. There tends to be an agreement dividing up the 14 posts between the groups, and thus they are usually elected without formal opposition. However, in 2009 Edward McMillan-Scott, through the individual support of 40 MEPs, successfully challenged his group's (the European Conservatives and Reformists) formal candidate; Micha Kamiski. Having been elected and prevented the election of Kaminski, McMillan-Scott was expelled from the ECR and Kaminski gained the group chair. 30 July 2004 to 16 January 2007 Elected (unopposed) in order of precedence; 16 January 2007 to 14 July 2009 Elected (unopposed) in order of precedence; 14 July 2009 to 17 January 2012 Elected in order of precedence; 17 January 2012 to 1 July 2014 Elected in order of precedence; Elected on July 1, 2014.
