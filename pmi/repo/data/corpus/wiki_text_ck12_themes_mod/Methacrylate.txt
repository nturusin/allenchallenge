Methacrylate refers to derivatives of methacrylic acid. These derivatives include the parent acid (CH2C(CH3)CO2H), salts (e.g., CH2C(CH3)CO2Na+), esters (e.g. CH2C(CH3)CO2CH3, or methyl methacrylate) and the polymers of these species. Methacrylates are common monomers in polymer plastics, forming the acrylate polymers. Methacrylates easily form polymers because the double bonds are very reactive. They are used as the monomer resin in some windscreen repair kits, and as bone cement for fixing prosthetic devices in orthopaedic surgery. Recently, organicinorganic hybrid nanobuilding blocks of methacrylate-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (T8, T10, and T12) were easily prepared and separated in their pure forms, which are promising candidate monomers to prepare any hybrid polymer nanocomposites.
