Rapid transit track gauge is often 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 12 in) standard gauge, but also 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm), 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 38 in), 1,524 mm (5 ft), and 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in). Delhi Metro uses Indian gauge, but new lines are built to 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 12 in). Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) uses Indian gauge, though most railroad lines in the United States are built to 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 12 in) gauge. Braslia Metro Belo Horizonte Metro Porto Alegre Metro Rio de Janeiro Metro So Paulo Metro - new lines use standard gauge MarketFrankford Line Helsinki Metro 21 km Moscow Metro (312 km) uses 1,524 mm (5 ft). Madrid Metro (293 km) uses 1,445 mm (4 ft 8 78 in). The Toronto Subway (68.3 km) uses 1495 mm. Some of the largest subway systems in the world use standard gauge in agreement with the country wide dominant usage for track gauge, e.g. : Asia: Seoul Metropolitan Subway, Beijing Subway, Shanghai Metro, Mass Rapid Transit Americas: New York City Subway, Mexico City Metro. Europe: London Underground Paris Mtro. Some networks use standard gauge while the country wide standard for track gauge is different, e.g. : Buenos Aires Underground - country uses Indian gauge Santiago Metro - country uses Indian gauge RapidKL Rail - country standard is Meter gauge Manila Light Rail Transit System - country uses 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge Mumbai Metro (planned) - country standard is Indian gauge Ho Chi Minh City Metro (planned) - country standard is Meter gauge Bogot Metro (planned) - country standard is three foot gauge Train for the vicinities of the city of Bogot (planned) - country standard is three foot gauge In some networks new lines are built to standard gauge while old lines in the network use another gauge, e.g. : Delhi Metro - old lines use Indian gauge So Paulo Metro - old lines use Irish gauge, country standard is Meter gauge Tokyo (Toei Shinjuku Line) Glasgow Subway Majority of Tokyo Metro, and Toei Mita Line Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit Metrovalencia In some networks multiple gauges are used even amongst lines that are built around the same time, like the Toei Subway which uses three gauges: 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge (Toei Mita Line) 4 ft 6 in (1,372 mm) (Toei Shinjuku Line) Standard gauge (Toei Asakusa Line, Toei Oedo Line) The Tokyo Metro uses two gauges: standard gauge for the Ginza and Marunouchi Lines, and 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) for all other lines. In other networks, very similar track gauges may be used, as is the case with the Hong Kong MTR (1,432 mm (4 ft 8 38 in) and 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 12 in)).
