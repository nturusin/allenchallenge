Ipriflavone is a synthetic isoflavone which may be used to inhibit bone resorption, maintain bone density and to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is not used to treat osteoporosis. It slows down the action of the osteoclasts (bone-eroding cells), possibly allowing the osteoblasts (bone-building cells) to build up bone mass. A clinical trial reported in 2001 that it was not effective in prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. A double-blind study reveals that ipriflavone might be effective on reducing tinnitus on otosclerosis sufferers.
