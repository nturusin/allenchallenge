Fisher's inequality, is a necessary condition for the existence of a balanced incomplete block design which satisfies certain prescribed conditions in combinatorial mathematics. Outlined by Ronald Fisher, a population geneticist and statistician, it concerns with the design of experiments studying the differences among several different varieties of plants, under each of a number of different growing conditions, called "blocks". Let: v be the number of varieties of plants; b be the number of blocks. It was required that: k different varieties are in each block, k < v; no variety occurs twice in any one block; any two varieties occur together in exactly blocks; each variety occurs in exactly r blocks. Fisher's inequality states simply that Let the incidence matrix M be a vb matrix defined so that Mi,j is 1 if element i is in block j and 0 otherwise. Then B=MMT is a vv matrix such that Bi,i = r and Bi,j = for i j. Since r , det(B) 0, so rank(B) = v; on the other hand, rank(B) = rank(M) b, so v b. Fisher's inequality is valid for more general classes of designs. A "pairwise balanced design" (or PBD) is a set X together with a family of subsets of X (which need not have the same size and may contain repeats) such that every pair of distinct elements of X is contained in exactly (a positive integer) subsets. The set X is allowed to be one of the subsets, and if all the subsets are copies of X, the PBD is called "trivial". The size of X is v and the number of subsets in the family (counted with multiplicity) is b. Theorem: For any non-trivial PBD, v b. This result also generalizes the Erds-De Bruijn theorem: For a PBD with = 1 having no blocks of size 1 or size v, v b, with equality if the PBD is a projective plane or a near-pencil (meaning that exactly n - 1 of the points are collinear).
