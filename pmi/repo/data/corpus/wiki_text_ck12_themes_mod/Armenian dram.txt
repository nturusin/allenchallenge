The dram (Armenian: ; sign: ; code: AMD) is the monetary unit of Armenia. It is subdivided into 100 luma (Armenian: ). The word "dram" translates into English as "money" and is cognate with the Greek drachma and the Arabic dirham. The first instance of a dram currency was in the period from 1199 to 1375, when silver coins called dram were issued. On 21 September 1991, a national referendum proclaimed Armenia as an independent republic from the Soviet Union. The Central Bank of Armenia, established on 27 March 1993, was given the exclusive right of issuing the national currency. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union attempts were made to maintain a common currency (the Russian ruble) among CIS states. Armenia joined this rublezone. However it soon became clear that maintaining a common currency in the unstable political and economical circumstances of the post-Soviet states would be very difficult. The rublezone effectively collapsed with the unilateral monetary reform in Russia, 1993. As result the states that were still participating (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia) were 'pushed out' and forced to introduce separate currencies. Armenia was one of the last countries to do so when it introduced the dram on 22 November 1993. In 1995 the currency sign for the Armenian dram was designed. The Armenian dram is also used in the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. A separate currency, the Nagorno-Karabakh dram, which circulates together with the Armenian dram was introduced during 2005. Coins and banknotes ranging in nominal values from 50 luma to 10 dram were issued. Officially the Nagorno-Karabakh dram is legal tender in both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. In practice it is however mostly sold as souvenirs due to the low nominal values of the coins and notes issued. In 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5 and 10 dram. In 2003 and 2004, a second series consisting of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dram coins was introduced to replace the first series. The Central Bank has also issued a great number of commemorative coins intended for sale to collectors. A listing can be found at [1] or [2]. In 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5 and 10 dram. At present only the 10 dram coin is still in use. The other coins are officially in circulation but not really used because of to their low nominal value. All coins bear the year of the first issue (1994). In 2003 and 2004, a new coinage consisting of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dram coins was introduced. All coins bear the year of the first issue (2003 or 2004). A first series of banknotes was issued in November 1993. It was withdrawn from circulation by 2005. A second series was issued from 1998 onwards which is still in use at present. On 22 November 1993, banknotes of 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dram were issued. Notes for 1000 and 5000 dram were put into circulation later. The banknotes of 500 dram are rarely seen in circulation. The 500 dram coin is used instead. A commemorative 50,000 dram note was issued on 4 June 2001 to observe the 1700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity in Armenia. The modern dram came into effect on 22 November 1993, at a rate of 200 rubles = 1 dram (1 USD : 404 AMD). The dram is not pegged to any currency other than the Nagorno-Karabakh dram.
