Bolidomonas is a genus of unicellular picoplanktonic heterokonts. It was recently (1999) discovered. Genetically it is closely related to diatoms, but differs morphologically from them, lacking the silica frustule characteristic of diatoms. Bolidomonas cells have two flagella, chloroplasts with girdle lamella, and no eyespot. Photosynthetic pigments present in bolydophyte choroplasts include chlorophylls a, c1, c2, c3, fucoxanthin, diatoxanthin, diadinoxanthin. It includes the species Bolidomonas mediterranea.
