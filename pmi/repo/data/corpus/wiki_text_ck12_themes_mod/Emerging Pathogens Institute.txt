The Emerging Pathogens Institute is an interdisciplinary research institution associated with the University of Florida. The Institute is charged with fusing key disciplines to develop outreach, education, and research capabilities designed to preserve the region's health and economy, and to prevent or contain new and re-emerging diseases. The idea of this Institute was first created by the University of Florida faculty & researchers. They began designing the framework for the Emerging Pathogens Institute back in 2006. Since then, the university has secured funding from the state of Florida for a 80,000-square-foot (7,400 m2) facility that is estimated to cost $56 million. The structure will house the institute and numerous top researchers. EPI has several dedicated researchers, but is primarily composed of a consortium of researchers spanning nine colleges at UF: Medicine; Pharmacy; Dentistry; Public Health and Health Professions; Veterinary Medicine; Liberal Arts and Sciences; Engineering; Nursing; and Agricultural and Life Sciences. In March 2009, the Institute received a substantial grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This was the first time that the University of Florida has ever received direct funding from this foundation, and the grant was provided to help researchers develop tools to fight malaria. 2007Present J.
