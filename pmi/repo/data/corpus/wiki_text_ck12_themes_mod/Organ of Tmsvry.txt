Tmsvry organs, also known as temporal organs or postanntennal organs are specialized paired sensory organs found in certain groups of myriapods (e.g. centipedes and millipedes) and hexapods (e.g. springtails), located on the head near the base of the antennae. Various function of Tmsvry organs have been proposed, including sensing vibration, humidity, or light, although evidence for their true function is conflicting, and in groups such as millipedes its true function is unknown. The organs were first described by Hungarian biologist dn Tmsvry in 1883.
