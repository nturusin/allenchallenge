Formula Acceleration 1 (FA1) was a single make, open wheel auto racing series. It was unusual in its field in that competitors solely represented their nation as opposed to themselves or a team, the usual format in most formula racing series. FA1 was created in 2014 as the signature category in the Acceleration 2014 series of motorsport festivals. Rather than developing their own car, the series reduced costs substantially by utilising the Lola B05/52 which was used in the early years of the A1 Grand Prix series. They also continued to use the same 3.4 litre V8 engine built by Zytek Engineering. On 22 December 2014, it was announced that the series would be merged with Auto GP in 2015. This to ensure that at least 18 cars will participate in each race. It was also announced that the 2015 champion will be granted a Formula 1 test. All cars are mechanically identical and have been built with reducing costs in mind, which has led to an approximate price for the whole season of 450,000. FA1 will use the Lola B05/52, used in the A1 Grand Prix between 2005 and 2008.
