Apache PDFBox is an open source pure-Java library that can be used to create, render, print, split, merge, alter, verify and extract text and meta-data of PDF files. Open Hub reports over 4,000 commits (since the start as an Apache project) by 17 contributors representing more than 120,000 lines of code. PDFBox has a well established, mature codebase maintained by an average size development team with increasing Y-O-Y commits. Using the COCOMO model, it took an estimated 33 person-years of effort. Apache PDFBox has these components: PDFBox: the main part FontBox: handles font information JempBox: handles XMP metadata Preflight (optional): checks PDF files for PDF/A-1b conformity. PDFBox was started in 2002 in SourceForge by Ben Litchfield who wanted to be able to extract text of PDF files for Lucene. It became an Apache Incubator project in 2008, and an Apache top level project in 2009. Preflight was originally named PaDaF and developed by Atos worldline, and donated to the project in 2011. In February 2015, Apache PDFBox was named an Open Source Partner Organization of the PDF Association.
