Nathaniel David Mermin (/mrmn/; born 1935) is a solid-state physicist at Cornell University best known for the eponymous MerminWagner theorem, his application of the term "Boojum" to superfluidity, and for the quote "Shut up and calculate!" Together with Neil Ashcroft, Mermin has written an esteemed textbook, Solid State Physics. Mermin is a proponent of Quantum Bayesianism. Mermin has published about 130 technical scientific articles, 20 pedagogical articles for scientists, 25 articles for the general reader, 35 book reviews, and 30 opinion pieces in Physics Today. Mermin has contributed to special relativity with two books and several articles. In It's About Time (2005) he suggests that the English foot be slightly modified: Henceforth, by 1 foot we shall mean the distance light travels in a nanosecond. A foot, if you will, is a light nanosecond (and a nanosecond, even more nicely, can be viewed as a light foot). If it offends you to redefine the foot then you may define 0.299792458 meters to be 1 phoot, and think "phoot" (conveniently evocative of the Greek , "light") whenever you read "foot". This adaptation of a physical unit is one of several ploys that Mermin uses to draw students into space-time geometry. ^ Ashcroft, Mermin 1976.
