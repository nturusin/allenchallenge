English inventions and discoveries are objects, processes or techniques invented or discovered, partially or entirely, by a person from England. (That is, someone born in England - including to non-English parents - or born abroad with at least one English parent and who had the majority of their education or career in England.) Often, things discovered for the first time are also called "inventions", and in many cases, there is no clear line between the two. Following is a list of inventions or discoveries generally believed to be English.
