Hungary is subdivided administratively into 19 counties (megyk, singular: megye) and the capital city (fvros) Budapest. The counties are further subdivided into 175 districts (jrsok, singular: jrs). The capital Budapest is subdivided into 23 districts (kerletek, singular: kerlet). There are 23 towns with county's rights (megyei jog vrosok, singular: megyei jog vros), sometimes called urban counties. The local authorities of these towns have extended powers but they are not independent territorial units. There are five towns with county's rights in addition to the county seats: rd (Pest county) Dunajvros (Fejr county) Hdmezvsrhely (Csongrd county) Nagykanizsa (Zala county) Sopron (Gyr-Moson-Sopron county)
