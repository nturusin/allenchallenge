Thomas H. Cormen is the co-author of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. In 2013, he published a new book titled Algorithms Unlocked. He is a Full Professor of computer science at Dartmouth College and currently Chair of the Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science. Between 2004 and 2008 he directed the Dartmouth College Writing Program. His research interests are algorithm engineering, parallel computing, speeding up computations with high latency. Thomas H. Cormen was born in New York City in 1956. He grew up in Oceanside, New York. He received his bachelor's degree summa cum laude in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University in June 1978. He then went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in May 1986 with a thesis on "Concentrator Switches for Routing Messages in Parallel Computers" and his PhD with a thesis on "Virtual Memory for Data-Parallel Computing" in February 1993. From July 2004 through June 2008, He was the director of the Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric. During his career he received several honors and awards: Elected to Phi Beta Kappa, Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu. National Science Foundation Fellowship.
