Georgia had victories against Clemson and South Carolina, but lost to one of its main rivals, Auburn. This was the team's first and only season under the guidance of head coach Branch Bocock, although he had coached three games in 1907 for head coach Bull Whitney. One of the players on the 1908 team was quarterback George "Kid" Woodruff. After a successful season, Woodruff traveled abroad in 1909 and returned to the University in 1910 and 1911 and eventually became the head coach of the Bulldogs in 1923.
