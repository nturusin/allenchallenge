The Taiwanese Romanization System (Taiwanese Romanization: Ti-un L-m-j Phing-im Hong-n, Chinese: ; pinyin: Tiwn Mnnny Lumz Pnyn Fng'n; Peh-e-j: Ti-an L-m-j Pheng-im Hong-n; often referred to as Ti-l) is a transcription system for Taiwanese Hokkien. It is derived from Peh-e-j and since 2006 has been officially promoted by Taiwan's Ministry of Education. In is nearly identical to TLPA apart from using ts tsh j instead of c ch j for the fricatives /ts ts dz/. Taiwanese Romanization System uses 16 basic Latin letters (A, B, E, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, T, U), 7 digraphs (Kh, Ng, nn, Oo, Ph, Th, Ts) and a trigraph (Tsh). In addition, it uses 6 diacritics to represent tones. "nn" is only used after a vowel to express nasalization, yet has no capital letter. Palatalization occurs when "J, S, Ts, Tsh" followed by "i", so "Ji, Si, Tsi, Tshi" sometimes governed as trigraphs and hexagraph. Of the 10 unused basic Latin letters, "R" is sometimes used to express dialectal vowels, while the others (C, D, F, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) are only used in loanwords. o pronounced [] in general dialect in Kaohsiung and Tainan, [o] in Taipei. -nn forms the nasal vowels There is also syllabic m and ng. ing actually pronounced [], ik actually pronounced [k]. A hyphen links elements of a compound word. A double hyphen indicates that the following syllable has a neutral tone and therefore that the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi.
