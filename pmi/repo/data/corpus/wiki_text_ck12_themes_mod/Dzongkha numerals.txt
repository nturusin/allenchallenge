Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan, has two numeral systems, one vigesimal (base 20), and a modern decimal system. The vigesimal system remains in robust use. Ten is an auxiliary base: the teens are formed with ten and the numerals 19. *When it appears on its own, 'ten' is usually said cu-tm 'a full ten'. In combinations it is simply cu. Factors of 20 are formed from ke. Intermediate factors of ten are formed with pe-da 'half to': 400 (202) iu is the next unit: iu ci 400, iu i 800, etc. Higher powers are 8000 (203) kece ('a reat score') and jce 160,000 (204). The decimal system is the same as the vigesimal system up to 19. Then decades, however, are formed as unitten, as in Chinese, and the hundreds similarly. 20 is reported to be iu, the vigesimal numeral 400; this may be lexical interference for the expected *i-cu. (In any case, there is no ambiguity, because as 400 it is obligatorily iu ci 'one 400'.) Several of the decades have an epenthetic -p-, perhaps by analogy with 18 and 19, where the -p- presumably reflects a historical *cup 'ten': sum-cu 30, i-p-cu 40, a-p-cu 50, a-tampa or cik-a 100 (a 'full hundred' or 'one hundred'), i-a 200, sum-a 300, i-p-a 400, etc.
