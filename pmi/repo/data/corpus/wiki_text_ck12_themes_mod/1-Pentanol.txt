1-Pentanol, (or n-pentanol, pentan-1-ol), is an alcohol with five carbon atoms and the molecular formula C5H11OH. 1-Pentanol is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant aroma. There are 8 alcohols with this molecular formula (see amyl alcohol). The ester formed from butyric acid and 1-pentanol, pentyl butyrate, smells like apricot. The ester formed from acetic acid and 1-pentanol, amyl acetate (pentyl acetate), smells like banana. Pentanol can be prepared by fractional distillation of fusel oil. To reduce the use of fossil fuels, research is underway to discover cost-effective methods of utilizing fermentation to produce Bio-Pentanol. Pentanol can be used as a solvent for coating CDs and DVDs. Another use is a replacement for gasoline.
