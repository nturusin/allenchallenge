In organic chemistry, isothiouronium is a functional group with the formula [RSC(NH2)2]+ (R = alkyl, aryl). The H centres can also be replaced by alkyl and aryl. Structurally, these cations resemble guanidinium cations. The CN2S core is planar and the C-N bonds are short. Salts comprising these anions are typically prepared by alkylation of thiourea: SC(NH2)2 + RX [RSC(NH2)2]+X Hydrolysis of isothiouronium salts gives thiols. [RSC(NH2)2]+X + NaOH RSH + OC(NH2)2 + NaX Chelating resins with isothiouronium groups are used to recover mercury and noble metals including platinum from solutions.
