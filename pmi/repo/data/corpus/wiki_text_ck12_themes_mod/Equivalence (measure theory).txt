In mathematics, and specifically in measure theory, equivalence is a notion of two measures being qualitatively similar. Specifically, the two measures agree on which events have probability zero. Let (X, ) be a measurable space, and let , : R be two signed measures. Then is said to be equivalent to if and only if each is absolutely continuous with respect to the other. In symbols: Thus, any event A is a null event with respect to , if and only if it is a null event with respect to : Equivalence of measures is an equivalence relation on the set of all measures R. Gaussian measure and Lebesgue measure on the real line are equivalent to one another. Lebesgue measure and Dirac measure on the real line are inequivalent.
