Currently the district, with the help of DeJong Inc. and the input of the community, is trying to craft a master plan to guide the district's building plans/renovations in the coming years. However, proposals to close smaller neighborhood schools, such as Corl Street and Lemont, in order to create larger consolidated elementary schools has been met with fierce opposition from the community. Many residents contend that the proposals are costly, wasteful of valuable resources, and poorly envisioned for its historic properties. In particular, the proposal to close Lemont Elementary School [1], a splendid limestone structure from the 1930s in the historic village of Lemont, has garnered community involvement. A group opposed to its closing has formed as the Friends of Lemont School to convince the District to remain committed to neighborhood schools and be respectful of its historic schools through rehabilitating them rather than abandoning them. The historic school's possible closure promises to be a bellwether election issue. In December 2010, the district administration reported that 889 pupils or 12.3% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal laws, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Coordinator of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. State College Area School District received a $3,221,641 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvanias Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal.

The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.
