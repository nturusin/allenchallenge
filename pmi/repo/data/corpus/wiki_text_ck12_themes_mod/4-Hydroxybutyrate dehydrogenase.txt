In enzymology, a 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.61) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction 4-hydroxybutanoate + NAD+ succinate semialdehyde + NADH + H+ The two substrates of this enzyme are therefore 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are succinate semialdehyde, NADH, and H+. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxybutanoate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called gamma-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism and the degradation of the neurotransmitter 4-hydroxybutanoic acid.
