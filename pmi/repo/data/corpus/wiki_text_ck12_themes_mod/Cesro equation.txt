In geometry, the Cesro equation of a plane curve is an equation relating the curvature () at a point of the curve to the arc length () from the start of the curve to the given point. It may also be given as an equation relating the radius of curvature () to arc length. (These are equivalent because .) Two congruent curves will have the same Cesro equation. Cesro equations are named after Ernesto Cesro. Some curves have a particularly simple representation by a Cesro equation. Some examples are: Line: . Circle: , where is the radius. Logarithmic spiral: , where is a constant. Circle involute: , where is a constant. Cornu spiral: , where is a constant. Catenary: . The Cesro equation of a curve is related to its Whewell equation in the following way. If the Whewell equation is then the Cesro equation is .
