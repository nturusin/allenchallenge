The ke (Chinese: ; pinyin: k) is a time unit in traditional China. The ke is the extension of the scale on the sundial or the rule of the water clock. In French decimal time, ke is equivalent to 10 decimal minutes, sometimes called a dcime. The major ke is 14.4 minutes (14 minutes 24 seconds), which is the time between two centiday scales, and the minor ke is 2.4 minutes (2 minutes 24 seconds), which is the common factor time between centiday scale and shi scale. It was customary to subdivide the minor ke into 10 fen (Chinese: ; pinyin: fn), just as cun and mace; thus the major ke is divided into 60 fen. There were various attempts to redefine a day to 96, 108, or 120 ke, in order to abolish the minor ke. During the Qing dynasty around the time of the arrival of Jesuit missionaries, the ke was finally redefined to 196 day, or 18 shi, or a quarter of an hour. And fen is currently used to refer to 160 of an hour, or 1 minute.
