The -factor is used to predict the solidliquid interface type of a material during solidification. According to John E. Gruzleski in his book Microstructure Development During Metalcasting (1996): = (L/k*TE)*(/v) where L is latent heat of fusion k is Boltzmanns constant TE is equilibrium freezing temperature is the number of nearest neighbours an atom has in the interface plane v is the number of nearest neighbours in the bulk solid Since L/TE = Sf where Sf is the molar entropy of fusion of the material = Sf/k(/v) According to Martin Glicksman in his book Principles of Solidification : An Introduction to Modern Casting and Crystal Growth Concepts(2011): = Sf/Rg(1/Z) where Rg is the universal gas constant, (1/Z) is similar to previous, always 1/4<(1/Z)<1
