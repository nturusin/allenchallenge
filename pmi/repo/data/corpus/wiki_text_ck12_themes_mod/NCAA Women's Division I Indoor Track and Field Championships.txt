The NCAA Women's Division I Indoor Track and Field Championship is an annual collegiate indoor track and field competition for women from Division I institutions organised by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Athletes' performances in individual championships earn points for their institutions and the team with the most points receives the NCAA team title in track and field. A separate NCAA Division I men's competition is also held. These two events are separate from the NCAA Women's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships and NCAA Men's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships held during the spring. The first edition of the championship was held in 1983. The current team champions are the Arkansas Razorbacks, and the most successful team, with 11 titles, are the LSU Lady Tigers.
