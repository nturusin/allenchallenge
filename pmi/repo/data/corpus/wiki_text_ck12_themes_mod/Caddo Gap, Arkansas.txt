Caddo Gap is a small unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Arkansas, United States. It lies between Glenwood and Norman on the Caddo River. It is best known as the area in which explorer Hernando de Soto and his forces clashed with the Tula tribe, a band loosely affiliated with the Caddo Confederacy. The expedition described the Tula Indians as the fiercest they had faced during their inward journey into North America. After this, the expedition turned back east, making it as far as the Mississippi River, where de Soto died. It is contested as to whether he died of fever, or from a wound received during the fighting. There the expedition had a secret burial ceremony and sent his body into the river. A monument to this event stands in the heart of the small community, which now has a population of fewer than 100. During the night of June 1011, 2010 a flash flood along Little Missouri River (Arkansas) killed at least twenty people in the campgrounds of the Albert Pike Recreational Area near Caddo Gap. In a matter of less than four hours water rose from three feet to over twenty-three feet. Osro Cobb, lawyer and politician
