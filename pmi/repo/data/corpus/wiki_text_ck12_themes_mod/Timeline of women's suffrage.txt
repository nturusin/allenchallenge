Women's suffrage the right of women to vote has been achieved at various times in countries throughout the world. In many nations, women's suffrage was granted before universal suffrage, so women and men from certain classes or races were still unable to vote. Some countries granted it to both sexes at the same time. This timeline lists years when women's suffrage was enacted. Some countries are listed more than once as the right was extended to more women according to age, land ownership, etc. In many cases, the first voting took place in a subsequent year. New Zealand became the first self-governing country in the world in which all women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections in 1893. In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was granted during the age of liberty between 1718 and 1771 to taxpaying female guild-members.
