The Cauchy formula for repeated integration, named after Augustin Louis Cauchy, allows one to compress n antidifferentiations of a function into a single integral (cf. Cauchy's formula). Let be a continuous function on the real line. Then the nth repeated integral of based at a, , is given by single integration . A proof is given by induction. Since is continuous, the base case follows from the Fundamental theorem of calculus: ; where . Now, suppose this is true for n, and let us prove it for n+1. Apply the induction hypothesis and switching the order of integration, The proof follows. In fractional calculus, this formula can be used to construct a notion of differintegral, allowing one to differentiate or integrate a fractional number of times. Integrating a fractional number of times with this formula is straightforward; one can use fractional n by interpreting (n-1)! as (n) (see Gamma function).
