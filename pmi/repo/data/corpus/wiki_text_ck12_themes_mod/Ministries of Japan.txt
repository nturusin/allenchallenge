The ministries of Japan are the most influential part of the executive branch of the Japanese government. Each ministry is headed by a Minister of State appointed by the Prime Minister. In postwar politics, the posts of ministers have been given to senior legislators, mostly of the LDP. However, few ministers serve for more than one or two years to develop the necessary grasp of the organisation to become really influential. Thus, most of the power lies within the ministries, with the senior bureaucrats. The Cabinet Office is responsible for handling the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. It consists of: National Public Safety Commission National Police Agency Consumer Affairs Agency Financial Services Agency Fair Trade Commission Food Safety Commission Imperial Household Agency Home Ministry (abolished in 1947) Ministry of War (abolished in 1945) Ministry of the Navy (abolished in 1945) Ministry of Colonial Affairs (abolished in 1942) Ministry of Greater East Asia (abolished in 1945) As a result of the Central Government Reform in 2001, many Ministries are reformed.
