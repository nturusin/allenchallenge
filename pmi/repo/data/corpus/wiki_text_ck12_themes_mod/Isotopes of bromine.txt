Bromine (Br) has two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br, and 30 known radioisotopes, the most stable of which is 77Br, with a half-life of 57.036 hours. Bromine and chlorine are the only halogens with more than one stable isotope. Standard atomic mass: 79.904(1) u ^ Abbreviations: IT: Isomeric transition ^ Bold for stable isotopes Values marked # are not purely derived from experimental data, but at least partly from systematic trends. Spins with weak assignment arguments are enclosed in parentheses. Uncertainties are given in concise form in parentheses after the corresponding last digits. Uncertainty values denote one standard deviation, except isotopic composition and standard atomic mass from IUPAC, which use expanded uncertainties.
