In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Janko group J3 or the Higman-Janko-McKay group HJM is a sporadic simple group of order 27 35 5 17 19 = 50232960 5107. J3 is one of the 26 Sporadic groups and was predicted by Zvonimir Janko in 1969 as one of two new simple groups having 21+4:A5 as a centralizer of an involution (the other is the Janko group J2). J3 was shown to exist by Graham Higman and John McKay (1969). J3 is one of the 6 sporadic simple groups called the pariahs because (Griess 1982) showed that it is not a subquotient of the monster group. J3 has an outer automorphism group of order 2 and a Schur multiplier of order 3, and its triple cover has a unitary 9-dimensional representation over the finite field with 4 elements. Weiss (1982) constructed it via an underlying geometry. It has a modular representation of dimension eighteen over the finite field with 9 elements. It has a complex projective representation of dimension eighteen. In terms of generators a, b, c, and d its automorphism group J3:2 can be presented as A presentation for J3 in terms of (different) generators a, b, c, d is Finkelstein & Rudvalis (1974) found the 9 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of J3 as follows: PSL(2,16):2, order 8160 PSL(2,19), order 3420 PSL(2,19), conjugate to preceding class in J3:2 24: (3 A5), order 2880 PSL(2,17), order 2448 (3 A6):22, order 2160 - normalizer of subgroup of order 3 32+1+2:8, order 1944 - normalizer of Sylow 3-subgroup 21+4:A5, order 1920 - centralizer of involution 22+4: (3 S3), order 1152
