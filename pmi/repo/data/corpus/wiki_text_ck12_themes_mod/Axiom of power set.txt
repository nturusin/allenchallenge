In mathematics, the axiom of power set is one of the ZermeloFraenkel axioms of axiomatic set theory. In the formal language of the ZermeloFraenkel axioms, the axiom reads: where P stands for the Power set of A, . In English, this says: Given any set A, there is a set such that, given any set B, B is a member of if and only if every element of B is also an element of A. More succinctly: for every set , there is a set consisting precisely of the subsets of . Note the subset relation is not used in the formal definition as subset is not a primitive relation in formal set theory; rather, subset is defined in terms of set membership, . By the axiom of extensionality, the set is unique. The axiom of power set appears in most axiomatizations of set theory. It is generally considered uncontroversial, although constructive set theory prefers a weaker version to resolve concerns about predicativity. The Power Set Axiom allows a simple definition of the Cartesian product of two sets and : Notice that and thus the Cartesian product is a set since One may define the Cartesian product of any finite collection of sets recursively: Note that the existence of the Cartesian product can be proved without using the power set axiom, as in the case of the KripkePlatek set theory.
