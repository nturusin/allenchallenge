In mathematics Alexander's theorem states that every knot or link can be represented as a closed braid. The theorem is named after James Waddell Alexander II, who published its proof in 1923. Braids were first considered as a tool of knot theory by Alexander. His theorem gives a positive answer to is it always possible to transform a given knot into a closed braid? However, the correspondence between knots and braids is clearly not one-to-one: a knot may have many braid representations. For example, conjugate braids yield equivalent knots. This leads to a second fundamental question: which closed braids represent the same knot type? That question is addressed in Markov's theorem, which gives moves relating any two closed braids that represent the same knot.
