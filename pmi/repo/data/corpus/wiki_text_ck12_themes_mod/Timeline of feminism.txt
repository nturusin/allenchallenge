Early 19th century A fundamental belief of the Society of Friends (Quakers) has always been the existence of an element of God's spirit in every human soul. Thus all persons are considered to have inherent and equal worth, independent of their gender, and this led to an acceptance of female ministers. In 1660, Margaret Fell (16141702) published a famous pamphlet to justify equal roles for men and women in the denomination, titled: "Women's Speaking Justified, Proved and Allowed of by the Scriptures, All Such as Speak by the Spirit and Power of the Lord Jesus And How Women Were the First That Preached the Tidings of the Resurrection of Jesus, and Were Sent by Christ's Own Command Before He Ascended to the Father (John 20:17)." In the United States, in contrast with almost every other organized denomination, the Society of Friends (Quakers) has allowed women to serve as ministers since the early 19th century. Furthermore, in England in the 17th century Elizabeth Hooton became the first female Quaker minister. 19th century Women's mosques, called nusi, and female imams have existed since the 19th century in China and continue today. 19th century Hannah Rachel Verbermacher, also known as the Maiden of Ludmir (Ludmirer Moyd), became the only female Rebbe in the history of the Hasidic movement; she lived in Ukraine and Israel. 1807 The Primitive Methodist Church in Britain first allowed female ministers. 1810 The Christian Connection Church, an early relative of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ, ordained women as early as 1810. 1815 Clarissa Danforth was ordained in New England.

Around eighty men and Thirih attended the conference. The conference is considered by Bbs and Bah's as a signal moment that demonstrated that Islamic Sharia law had been abrogated and superseded by Bb law, as well as a key demonstration of the thrust of raising the social position of women. Caroline Norton campaigns extensively for women's rights, helping induce the British Parliament to pass the Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, and the Married Women's Property Act 1870. 1850 The first National Women's Rights Convention in Worchester, MA.

In 1961, the Universalists and Unitarians joined to form the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). The UUA became the first large denomination to have a majority of female ministers. 1863 The Grand Principality of Finland was part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917 and enjoyed a high degree of autonomy.

However, the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges.
