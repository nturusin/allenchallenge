Light flyweight, also known as junior flyweight, is a weight class in boxing. The weight limit at light flyweight in professional boxing is 108 pounds (49 kilograms). When New York legalized boxing in 1920, the law stipulated a "junior flyweight" class, with a weight limit of 99 pounds. When the National Boxing Association was formed in 1921, it also recognized this weight class. However, on January 19, 1922, the NBA decided to withdraw recognition of the junior flyweight division. On December 31, 1929, the New York State Athletic Commission also abolished the junior flyweight class. No champion had been crowned in this division prior to its abolition. The World Boxing Council (WBC) decided to resurrect this division in the 1970s. The first champion in this division was Franco Udella, who won the WBC title in 1975. The World Boxing Association also crowned its first champion in 1975, when Jaime Rios defeated Rigoberto Marcano via fifteen-round decision. The first International Boxing Federation champion was Dodie Boy Penalosa, who won the belt in 1983. The first light flyweight "superfight" took place on March 13, 1993, when Michael Carbajal, the IBF champion, knocked out WBC champion Humberto Gonzlez to unify the championship. Their rematch, on February 19, 1994, was the first time a light flyweight fighter (Carbajal) made a million dollar purse. Yuh Myung-woo holds the record for most consecutive title defenses at this division, with 17 defenses of the WBA title. Current Champions At the Summer Olympic Games, the division is defined as up to 48 kilograms. 1968 Francisco Rodrguez (VEN) 1972 Gyrgy Ged (HUN) 1976 Jorge Hernndez (CUB) 1980 Shamil Sabirov (URS) 1984 Paul Gonzales (USA) 1988 Ivailo Marinov (BUL) 1992 Rogelio Marcelo (CUB) 1996 Daniel Petrov (BUL) 2000 Brahim Asloum (FRA) 2004 Yan Bartelem Varela (CUB) 2008 Zou Shiming (CHN) 2012 Zou Shiming (CHN) 1969 Gyrgy Ged (HUN) 1971 Gyrgy Ged (HUN) 1973 Vladislav Sasypko (URS) 1975 Aleksandr Tkachenko (URS) 1977 Henryk rednicki (POL) 1979 Shamil Sabirov (URS) 1981 Ismail Mustafov (BUL) 1983 Ismail Mustafov (BUL) 1985 Ren Breitbarth (GDR) 1987 Nszan Munczian (URS) 1989 Ivailo Marinov (BUL) 1991 Ivailo Marinov (BUL) 1993 Daniel Petrov (BUL) 1996 Daniel Petrov (BUL) 1998 Sergey Kazakov (RUS) 2000 Valeriy Sydorenko (UKR) 2002 Sergey Kazakov (RUS) 2004 Sergey Kazakov (RUS) 2006 David Ayrapetyan (RUS) 2008 Hovhannes Danielyan (ARM) 2010 Paddy Barnes (IRL) 2011 Salman Alizade (AZE) 2013 David Ayrapetyan (RUS) 1971 Rafael Carbonell (CUB) 1975 Jorge Hernndez (CUB) 1979 Hector Ramrez (CUB) 1983 Rafael Ramos (PUR) 1987 Luis Romn Roln (PUR) 1991 Rogelio Marcelo (CUB) 1995 Edgar Velzquez (VEN) 1999 Maikro Romero (CUB) 2003 Yan Bartelem Varela (CUB) 2007 Luis Yez (USA) 2011 Joselito Velazquez (MEX) Zou Shiming Jung-Koo Chang Yoko Gushiken Yuh Myung-woo Luis Estaba Humberto Gonzalez Michael Carbajal Leo Gamez Saman Sorjaturong Donnie Nietes
