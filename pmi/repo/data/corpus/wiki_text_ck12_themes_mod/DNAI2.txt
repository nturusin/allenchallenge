Dynein intermediate chain 2, axonemal, also known as axonemal dynein intermediate chain 2, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DNAI2 gene. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the dynein intermediate chain family, and is part of the dynein complex of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella. Mutations in the DNAI2 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia.
