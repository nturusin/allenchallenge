The Royal Society of New Zealand is an independent government body in New Zealand providing funding and policy advice in the fields of sciences and the humanities. The Society was founded in 1867 by Sir George Grey as the New Zealand Institute as an apex organisation in science, with the Auckland Institute, the Wellington Philosophical Society, the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury, and the Otago Institute as constituents. Publishing transactions and proceedings was its main early function. The name as changed to Royal Society of New Zealand in 1933, a reference to the London-based Royal Society, a move requiring royal assent and subsequent act of parliament. In 2010, the remit was expanded to include the social sciences and the humanities. Currently constituted under the Royal Society of New Zealand Act 1997 (as amended in 2012), the RSNZ exists: To foster in the New Zealand community a culture that supports science and technology, including (without limitation) (i) The promotion of public awareness, knowledge, and understanding of science and technology; and (ii) The advancement of science and technology education, To encourage, promote, and recognise excellence in science and technology, To provide an infrastructure and other support for the professional needs and development of scientists and technologists, To provide expert advice on important public issues to the Government and the community, To do all other lawful things which the Council considers conducive to the advancement and promotion of science and technology in New Zealand. It is a federation of 49 constituent scientific and technological organisations, and also several affiliate organisations, and it has individual members. The RSNZ's activities encompass: Science funding as a non-political funding distribution agency for government funding, particularly in science research and science education Publishing peer-reviewed journals such as NZ Journal of Botany and NZ Journal of Zoology Meetings and seminars most local branches and constituent scientific and technological organisations run seminar series of some descriptions, and the RSNZ promotes these and coordinates touring international lecturers. Awards and medals including: Rutherford Medal (formerly the Gold Medal) - awarded annually for exceptional contributions to the advancement and promotion of public awareness, knowledge and understanding in addition to eminent research or technological practice by a person or group in any field of science, mathematics, social science, or technology Pickering Medal awarded annually to recognise people who have made outstanding contributions to New Zealand society and culture in science, mathematics, social science, and technology. Silver and Bronze medals are also awarded Fleming Award for Environmental Achievement Hector Medal - awarded annually for outstanding work in chemical, physical or mathematical and information sciences by a researcher in New Zealand. Science education promotes quality science education and plays a role in setting the national science curriculum. The New Zealand Association of Scientists also works in similar fields, but is constituted as an independent non-profit incorporated society and registered charity, rather than being constituted by an Act of Parliament. The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology also works in similar fields, but as a crown entity is not independent from politics. On 10 July 2008, the Society released a statement on climate change that said in summary: The globe is warming because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Measurements show that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are well above levels seen for many thousands of years. Further global climate changes are predicted, with impacts expected to become more costly as time progresses. Reducing future impacts of climate change will require substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.
