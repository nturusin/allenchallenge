Real Betis Balompi, SAD, more commonly referred to as Real Betis (pronounced: [real etis]) or just Betis, is a Spanish football club based in Seville, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. Founded on 12 September 1907, it plays in La Liga, having won the Segunda Divisin in the 201415 season. It holds home games at Estadio Benito Villamarn in the south of the city. Among other titles, the club which in 1932 became the first Andalusian team to play in La Liga won the league title in 1935 and the Copa del Rey in 1977 and 2005. Maintaining an historic city rivalry with Sevilla FC, its motto is Viva el Betis manque pierda! ("Long live Betis even when they lose!"). The name is derived from Baetis, the Roman name for the Guadalquivir river which passes through Seville. Betis initially attracted support from the working classes although a large number of aristocrats, including the King of Spain also supported the team. Real was added in 1914 after the club received patronage from King Alfonso XIII. Betis' city rivals Sevilla Football Club were the first club in Seville, founded in October 1905, while a second club, Sevilla Balompi, were established in September 1907. Balompi translates literally as football, as opposed to the most commonly adopted anglicised version, ftbol. Balompi was founded by students from the local Polytechnic Academy, and were in operation for two years before being officially recognised (in 1909), despite this 1907 remains the official foundation date of the club. Following an internal split from Sevilla FC, another club was formed, Betis Football Club. In 1914 they merged with Sevilla Balompi. The club received its royal patronage in the same year, and therefore adopted the name Real Betis Balompi. Fans continued to refer to the club as Balompi, and were themselves known as Los Balompedistas, until the 1930s when Betis and the adjective Bticos became common terminology when discussing the club and its followers. During the Spanish Second Republic (19311939), royal patronage of all organisations was nullified, and thus the club was known as Betis Balompi until after the Spanish Civil War when it would revert to the full name. The club reached the Copa del Presidente de la Repblica final for the first time on 21 June 1931, when it lost 31 to Athletic Bilbao in Madrid. Betis marked their 25th anniversary year by winning their first Segunda Divisin title in 1932, finishing two points ahead of Oviedo FC, thus becoming the first club from Andalusia to play in La Liga. Under the guidance of Irish coach Patrick O'Connell on 28 April 1935 Betis won the La Liga, to date their only top division title. They topped the table by a single point over Madrid FC. A year later Betis went down to seventh. This was due to the dismantling of the championship-winning team because of the club's poor economic situation and the arrival of the Civil War, meaning that just 15 months after lifting the league title only two players who won in 1935 were left: Peral and Saro. No official league was held during the Civil War between 1936 and 1939, until its resumption for the 193940 season and the first year back highlighted Betis' decline as exactly five years after winning the title the club was relegated. Despite a brief return to the top division, which lasted only one season, the club continued to decline and in 1947 the worst fears were reached when they were relegated to Tercera Divisin. Many fans see the ten years they spent in the category as key to the 'identity' and 'soul' of the club, a time that saw it win sympathies all across Spain. During this time Betis earned a reputation for filling its stadium and having a massive support at away matches, known as the Green March. When the side returned to the second level in 1954, it gained the distinction of being the only club in Spain to have won all three major divisions' titles. Much of the credit for guiding Betis through this dark period and back into the Segunda lies with chairman Manuel Ruiz Rodrguez. In 1955, Manuel Ruiz Rodrguez stepped down from running the club believing he couldn't offer further economic growth, he was replaced by Betis most famous former president Benito Villamarn. During his reign Betis returned to the top division in 195859 and achieved a best-ever third position in 1964. His purchase of the Estadio Helipolis in 1961 is seen as a key point in the history of the club the grounds were called the Estadio Benito Villamarn until 1997. Villamarn is also credited with helping launch rising star Luis del Sol, who would go on to earn 16 caps for Spain, but also had to make unpopular decisions such as selling him. Villamarn would step aside after 10 years at the helm and would die of cancer one year later, in 1966. Just one year after Villamarn's departure the club would again be relegated to division two, then rising and falling almost consecutively until consolidating their place in the top level from 197475. On 25 June 1977, Betis played Athletic Bilbao at the Vicente Caldern Stadium, Madrid, in the Copa del Rey final. The match finished 22, with Betis winning 87 after a staggering 21 penalties. This rounded off a solid season in which the club finished fifth in the league. After that triumph, Betis competed in the European Cup Winners' Cup: after knocking out A.C. Milan 32 on aggregate in the first round, the side reached the quarterfinals where they lost to FC Dynamo Moscow. In spite of a good overall performance in Europe, the team suffered league relegation. The following year Betis quickly returned to the top flight and a period of good times for the club. The next three seasons saw three top-six finishes, and UEFA Cup qualification in 1982 and 1984. 1982 saw a first round defeat to S.L. Benfica, who would go on lose in the final, and the next participation also ended in the first round, on penalties against FC Universitatea Craiova. During the summer of 1982, the Benito Villamarn hosted two matches as part of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and also witnessed the Spanish national team's famous 121 hammering of Malta in order to qualify for UEFA Euro 1984. In 1986, Betis lost in the final of the soon-to-be defunct Spanish League Cup, against FC Barcelona. Betis again returned to a club rising and falling from the First almost every season until 1992 when it was forced to meet new rules and regulations, meaning the club was required to cover a capital of 1,200 million pesetas, roughly double that of all the first and second division teams, despite being in level two at the time. In just three months the fans raised 400 million pesetas, an equivalent to between 60100% of most top division teams, and vice-president Manuel Ruiz de Lopera stepped in providing economic guarantee while himself becoming majority shareholder as the team narrowly avoided relegation. After another three seasons in the second division, with the club managed by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, Betis returned to the top flight for the 199495 season, subsequently achieving a final third position, thus qualifying to the UEFA Cup. In the European campaign, Betis knocked out Fenerbahe SK (41 on aggregate) and 1. FC Kaiserslautern (41) before losing to defeated finalists FC Girondins de Bordeaux (32). In 1997, thirty years after winning the trophy for the first time, the club returned to the final of the Spanish Cup, again in Madrid, although this time at the Santiago Bernabu, losing 23 against Barcelona, after extra time. Incidentally Bara was the club Serra Ferrer would leave Betis for that summer, to be replaced by former player Luis Aragons. Aragons would only last one season with the club leading in to the eighth position, and to the quarterfinals in the Cup Winners' Cup, losing 25 on aggregate to eventual winners Chelsea. Aragons was followed by the controversial reign of Javier Clemente, who spat on a fan and implied Andalusia was another country! The team slipped down the table, finishing eleventh and being knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Bologna F.C. 1909 in the third round. For the next couple of seasons Betis went through numerous managers, a relegation and a promotion, after which the team finished sixth in the league, with Juande Ramos at the helm. Ramos was gone after just one season, being replaced by former Cup Winners' Cup-winning manager Vctor Fernndez. He led the team to eighth and ninth in the league and the third round of the 200203 UEFA Cup, being knocked out by AJ Auxerre (12 on aggregate), during his two-year reign. For 2004, Fernandez was replaced by the returning Serra Ferrer who guided the team to the fourth position in the top flight. They also returned to the Vicente Caldern, on 11 June 2005 for the domestic cup final, lifting the trophy for only the second time after an extra-time winner by youth graduate Dani, in a 21 win against CA Osasuna. The league finish meant Betis became the first Andalucian team to compete in the UEFA Champions League, and it reached the group stage after disposing of AS Monaco in the last qualifying round (32 on aggregate). Drawn in Group G, and in spite of a 10 home win against Chelsea, the club eventually finished third, being "demoted" to the UEFA Cup, where it would be ousted in the round of 16 by defeated FC Steaua Bucureti (00 away draw, 03 home loss). Betis celebrated their centenary year in 2007. The festivities included a special match against AC Milan, the reigning European Champions, on 9 August, with the hosts winning 10 thanks to a Mark Gonzlez penalty early in the second half. Seven days later, the club won the Ramon de Carranza Trophy held in neighbouring Cdiz, beating Real Zaragoza on penalties in the final, after defeating Real Madrid in the semi-final. Surrounding the celebration, it was a time of great change in terms of the playing and technical teams, with eight new signings replacing fourteen departures. During the two seasons (200607 and 200708) that encompassed the centenary year Betis had four different managers. During the latter campaign, the club was the 37th-best followed team in Europe regarding average attendances. After many years of staving off relegation, Betis' 200809 season culminated with a 11 draw against Real Valladolid at home. With this outcome, the club finished 18th in the table and consequently was relegated to the second division. On 15 June 2009, over 65,000 Beticos including icons such as Rafael Gordillo, del Sol, Hiplito Rincn, Julio Cardeosa and others joined the protest march in Sevilla with the slogan "15-J Yo Voy Betis" to let the majority owner Ruiz de Lopera know that it was time to put his 54% share of the club on the market for someone, some entity or the Betis supporters to buy those shares and remove Lopera from the day-to-day operations of the club." Despite the protests, no upper management changes were made during the season, which would ultimately see Betis fail to gain promotion back to the top level. Sevilla judge Mercedes Alaya was investigating links between Betis and other Ruiz de Lopera-owned businesses leading to him being formally charged with fraud. On 7 July 2010, one week before the start of preliminary court proceedings, Lopera sold 94% of the shares that he owned (51% of Betis total shares) to Bitton Sport, fronted by Luis Oliver, for the surprisingly low figure of 16 million, leaving Lopera with only minor shares; Oliver had already reportedly taken two football clubs, Cartagena FC and Xerez CD, to the brink of bankruptcy. However, before the sale could be officially sanctioned Ayala froze Lopera shareholdings. Left with nothing, despite putting down a 1 million deposit, Oliver hastily bought a nominal number of shares from a third party and was voted onto the board of directors by the existing members (all former cohorts of Lopera), allowing him to carry on running the club. In response to this, the judge appointed well-respected former Betis, Real Madrid and Spain legend Rafael Gordillo to administrate Lopera's shares to ensure Lopera was not still running the club and that decisions made were for the benefit of the club not individual board members. Again under Pepe Mel, Betis started 201112 with four wins in as many games, with Rubn Castro retaining his goal scoring form from the previous season, where he scored 27 goals. Betis finished 13th in their first season since returning to La Liga. In the 201213 season Betis finished 7th in La Liga and qualified for the 201314 UEFA Europa League, the first European qualification for the club since the 200506 UEFA Champions League. This European campaign ended in the quarter-finals after losing on penalties to local rivals Sevilla. Betis were relegated from La Liga with three games still to play in the 201314 season, but returned immediately as champions with two games to spare. Betis have a long-standing rivalry with city neighbours Sevilla FC. The two have met 114 times in official competition, with Sevilla holding a 45% win ratio over Betis (31%). The first match between the two clubs took place on 8 February 1915, with Sevilla winning 43. The match was not completed, as high tensions led an aggressive crowd to invade the pitch, forcing the referee to abandon the match. In 1916, the first Copa Andaluca was held, this being the first official derby of the Seville area. Of the 17 runnings of the cup, Sevilla were victorious 14 times, to Betis' one sole conquest; this included a 220 routing after the latter sent their youth team, in 1918. The first time the teams met in league, in Segunda, happened in 192829, with both teams winning their home matches (30 and 21). They played for the first time in the Spanish top division during the 193435 season, with a 03 home defeat for Sevilla and a 22 draw at Betis, with the latter winning the national championship. On 17 January 1943, Betis lost 50 at Sevilla, eventually being relegated. In the first game held at the Ramn Snchez Pizjun stadium, on 21 September 1958, the Verdiblancos won it 42. In later years, several matches were also marred by violence, including: a security guard attacked by a Sevilla fan with a crutch (that he did not require to walk), Betis goalkeeper Toni Prats being attacked and Sevilla manager Juande Ramos being struck by a bottle of water; the latter incident led to the 2007 Spanish Cup match being suspended, being played out three weeks later in Getafe with no spectators. On 7 February 2009, Betis won 21 at the Pizjun, but was eventually relegated from the top flight, while Sevilla finished in third position. = Played 84, with 18 draws.

It was named Estadio Manuel Ruiz de Lopera during the 2000s (decade) after the club's owner, who decided to build a new stadium over the old one. Despite much planning, the stadium's renovation plans were constantly postponed, and half of it remained unchanged. On 27 October 2010, it returned to its first denomination after a decision by the club's associates. In its initial years, Sevilla Balompi dressed in blue shirts with white shorts, which represented the infantry at the time. From late 1911 the team had adopted the shirts of Celtic, at that time vertical stripes of green and white, that were brought over from Glasgow by Manuel Asensio Ramos, who had studied in Scotland as a child. When the team became Real Betis Balompi in 1914, various kits were used, including: yellow and black stripes; green t-shirts and a reversion to the blue top and white shorts uniform. By the end of the 1920s Betis was once again sporting green and white stripes, around this time the Assembly of Ronda (1918) saw the Andalusian region formally adopt these colours, not being known how much the two are linked. Since then this remained Betis' shirt, despite several versions (including wider stripes).
