In five-dimensional geometry, a 5-orthoplex, or 5-cross polytope, is a five-dimensional polytope with 10 vertices, 40 edges, 80 triangle faces, 80 tetrahedron cells, 32 5-cell 4-faces. It has two constructed forms, the first being regular with Schlfli symbol {33,4}, and the second with alternately labeled (checkerboarded) facets, with Schlfli symbol {3,3,31,1} or Coxeter symbol 211. It is a part of an infinite family of polytopes, called cross-polytopes or orthoplexes. The dual polytope is the 5-hypercube or 5-cube. pentacross, derived from combining the family name cross polytope with pente for five (dimensions) in Greek. Triacontaditeron (or triacontakaiditeron) - as a 32-facetted 5-polytope (polyteron). Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a 5-orthoplex, centered at the origin are (1,0,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0,0), (0,0,1,0,0), (0,0,0,1,0), (0,0,0,0,1) There are three Coxeter groups associated with the 5-orthoplex, one regular, dual of the penteract with the C5 or [4,3,3,3] Coxeter group, and a lower symmetry with two copies of 5-cell facets, alternating, with the D5 or [32,1,1] Coxeter group, and the final one as a dual 5-orthotope, called a 5-fusil which can have a variety of subsymmetries. This polytope is one of 31 uniform 5-polytopes generated from the B5 Coxeter plane, including the regular 5-cube and 5-orthoplex.
