The 2010 Jupiter impact event was a bolide impact event on Jupiter by an object estimated to be about 813 meters in diameter. The impactor may have been an asteroid, comet, centaur, extinct comet, or temporary satellite capture. The impact happened 3 June 2010, and was recorded and first reported by amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley from Australia. The event was confirmed by Christopher Go at the Philippines, who recorded the event, and has released a video. Wesley is the same person who had been first to report the 2009 Jupiter impact event. The observed flash lasted about two seconds. It was located in the South Equatorial Belt, about fifty degrees from the central meridian. The June 2010 superbolide impactor probably measured between 813 meters across, with a mass between 500-2000 metric tons. Jupiter probably gets hit by several objects of this size each year. On 20 August 2010 UT, yet another flash event was detected on Jupiter. As of August 23 two other observers had recorded the same event. In July 1994 the Comet ShoemakerLevy 9 broke apart and collided with Jupiter, resulting in a series of hits. This incident had been predicted in advance. On 19 July 2009 an impact was observed, which caused a black spot on Jupiter's atmosphere. This unpredicted event was first reported by Anthony Wesley, who also first observed the 2010 event. The 2009 impact has been studied by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, and the study suggests that the observed incident was a hit by an asteroid about 500 metres wide. On 10 September 2012 at 11:35 UT amateur astronomer Dan Petersen visually detected a fireball on Jupiter that lasted 1 or 2 seconds using a Meade 12 LX200. George Hall had been recording Jupiter with a webcam on his 12" Meade; upon hearing the news Hall checked the video to see if the impact was captured. Hall had indeed captured a 4-second clip of the impact and released the video to the public. The impact's estimated position in the system was longitude = 345 and latitude = +2. Dr Michael H. Wong estimated that the fireball was created by a meteoroid less than 10 meters in diameter. Several collisions of this size may happen on Jupiter on a yearly basis. The 2012 impact was the 5th impact observed on Jupiter, and the fourth impact seen on Jupiter between 2009 and 2012. It was quite similar to the flash observed on 20 August 2010.
