Jan opuszaski (21 October 1923 30 April 2008) was a Polish theoretical physicist and author of several textbooks about classical, statistical and quantum physics. In the field of quantum field theory, he is most famous as co-author of the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem concerning the possibility of supersymmetry in renormalizable QFT's. Jan opuszaski was born on 21 October 1923 in Lww, Poland. During 1945-50 he studied physics at the University of Wrocaw. In 1950, he received his M.A. in Wrocaw, in 1955 his Ph.D. at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. Since 1947, he was part of regular staff member at the University of Wrocaw.

From 1970 to 1984, he was director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics (Instytut Fizyki Teoretycznej Uniwersytet Wroclawski). From 1960 onward, he held the chair for mathematical methods in physics until he retired in 1994. In 1976, he was elected a corresponding member and in 1986 permanent member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1996, he became a corresponding member of the Poland Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cracow.
