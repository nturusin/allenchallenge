Kazehakase (Japanese: Dr. Wind (, kaze hakase) is a web browser for Unix-like operating systems that uses the GTK+ libraries. Kazehakase embeds the Gecko layout engine as well as GTK+ WebKit. However, the author also plans to add the ability to switch between additional different rendering engines (e.g. GtkHTML, Dillo, w3m). The browser is named after the short story "Kazehakase" by the Japanese author Ango Sakaguchi; its literal meaning is "Dr. Wind" (a PhD rather than a medical doctor). Kazehakase is free software, available under the GNU General Public License. It has been available at repositories for Debian and Ubuntu, and has been ported to FreeBSD. Kazehakase seems no longer in active development since 2012. Notable features include: Support for RSS as well as its Japanese variants LIRS and HINA-DI Drag-and-drop of browser tabs Mouse gestures Import of bookmarks from Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Application Suite, Netscape Browser, Galeon, Konqueror, and w3m; shared bookmarks (with XBEL) "Smart Bookmarks" programmable with regular expressions Full text search in browser history
