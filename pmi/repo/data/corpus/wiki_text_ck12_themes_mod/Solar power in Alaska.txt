Solar power in Alaska has been primarily used in remote locations, such as the Nenana Teen Center, near Fairbanks, where long summer days provide most of the electricity generated. Rooftop solar panels could provide 23% of all electricity used in Alaska. Net metering is available for PV systems up to 25 kW but is limited to 1.5% of average demand. IREC best practices, based on experience, recommends no limits to net metering, individual or aggregate, and perpetual roll over of kWh credits. In 2011, Alaska's largest solar array was the 17.28 kW array installed on a building in Anchorage. A 12 kW solar array installed in Lime Village in July 2001 helped reduce electricity costs.
