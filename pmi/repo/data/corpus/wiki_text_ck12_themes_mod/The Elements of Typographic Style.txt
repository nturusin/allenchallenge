The Elements of Typographic Style is the authoritative book on typography and style by Canadian typographer, poet and translator Robert Bringhurst. Originally published in 1992 by Hartley & Marks Publishers, it was revised in 1996, 2001 (v2.4), 2002 (v2.5), 2004 (v3.0), 2005 (v3.1), 2008 (v3.2), and 2012 (v4.0). A history and guide to typography, it has been praised by Hermann Zapf, who said I wish to see this book become the Typographers Bible. Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones consider it "the finest book ever written about typography," according to the FAQ section of their type foundry's website. Because of its status as a respected and frequently cited resource, typographers and designers often refer to it simply as Bringhurst. The title alludes to The Elements of Style, the classic guide to writing by Strunk and White. The titles of the chapters in the book's fourth edition are as follows: The Grand Design Rhythm & Proportion Harmony & Counterpoint Structural Forms & Devices Analphabetic Symbols Choosing & Combining Type Historical Interlude Shaping the Page The State of the Art Grooming the Font Prowling the Specimen Books In addition to these chapters, the book also contains five appendices, a historical synopsis, a foreword, and an afterword.
