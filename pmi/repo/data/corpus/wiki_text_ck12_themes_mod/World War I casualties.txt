The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I was over 38 million: over 17 million deaths and 20 million wounded, ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history. The total number of deaths includes about 11 million military personnel and about 7 million civilians. The Triple Entente (also known as the Allies) lost about 6 million military personnel while the Central Powers lost about 4 million. At least 2 million died from diseases and 6 million went missing, presumed dead. This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources. About two-thirds of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century when the majority of deaths were due to disease. Nevertheless, disease, including the 1918 flu pandemic and deaths while held as prisoners of war, still caused about one third of total military deaths for all belligerents. Casualty statistics for World War I vary to a great extent; estimates of total deaths range from 9 million to over 15 million. Military casualties reported in official sources list deaths due to all causes, including an estimated 7 to 8 million combat related deaths (killed or died of wounds) and another two to three million military deaths caused by accidents, disease and deaths while prisoners of war. Official government reports listing casualty statistics were published by the United States and Great Britain. These secondary sources published during the 1920s, are the source of the statistics in reference works listing casualties in World War One. This article summarizes the casualty statistics published in the official government reports of the United States and Great Britain as well as France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Russia. More recently the research of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has revised the military casualty statistics of the U.K. and its allies; they include in their listing of military war dead personnel outside of combat theaters and civilians recruited from Africa, the Middle East and the China who provided logistical and service support in combat theaters. The casualties of these support personnel recruited outside of Europe were previously not included with British war dead, however the casualties of the Labour Corps recruited from the British Isles were included in the rolls of British war dead published in 1921. The methodology used by each nation to record and classify casualties was not uniform, a general caveat regarding casualty figures is that they cannot be considered comparable in all cases. First World War civilian deaths are "hazardous to estimate" according to Michael Clodfelter who maintains that "the generally accepted figure of noncombatant deaths is 6.5 million." The figures listed below include about 6 million excess civilian deaths due to war related privations, that are often omitted from other compilations of World War I casualties. The war brought about malnutrition and disease caused by the U-boat Campaign and the Blockade of Germany which disrupted trade resulting in food shortages. The civilian deaths in the Ottoman Empire include the Armenian Genocide, Assyrian Genocide and Greek Genocide. Civilian deaths due to the Spanish flu have been excluded from these figures, whenever possible. The figures do not include deaths during the Turkish War of Independence and the Russian Civil War. (when the number of deaths in a country is disputed, a range of war losses is given) (sources and details of the figures are provided in the footnotes) The war involved multi-ethnic empires such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Austro-Hungary and Turkey. Many diverse ethnic groups in these multi-ethnic empires were conscripted for military service. The casualties listed by modern borders are also included in the above table of figures for the countries that existed in 1914. The casualty figures by 1924 post war borders are rough estimates by Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, the sources of his figures were published in the Soviet era and in post-Soviet Russia. Austria The following estimates of Austrian deaths, within contemporary borders, were made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 175,000: including military losses 120,000 with the Austo-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 30,000. Civilian dead due to famine and disease were 25,000. Democratic Republic of the Congo The Belgian Congo was part of the Kingdom of Belgium during the war. A Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia estimated a total of 155,000 deaths in the Belgian Congo during the war. Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia was part of Austro-Hungary during the war. The estimates of Czechoslovak deaths within 1991 borders were made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 185,000: including military losses 110,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 45,000. Civilian dead due to famine and disease were 30,000. The Czechoslovak Legions fought with the armies of the Allies during the war. Estonia Estonia was part of the Russian Empire during the war and about 100,000 Estonians served in the Russian Army. Of them about 10,000 were killed. Finland From 1809 Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. In 1924 the Finnish government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 26,517 were dead and missing in World War I. French colonies The following estimates of deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Erlikman's estimates are based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia. Algeria (1914 known as French Algeria): 26,000 Vietnam (1914 known as French Indochina): 12,000 Mali (1914 part of French West Africa): 60,000 Morocco (1914 known as the French protectorate of Morocco): 8,000 Senegal (1914 part of French West Africa): 36,000 Guinea (1914 part of French West Africa): 14,500 Madagascar: 2,500 military Benin (1914 part of French West Africa): 27,000 Burkina Faso (1914 part of French West Africa): 17,000 Republic of the Congo (1914 part of French Equatorial Africa): 32,000 Ivory Coast (1914 part of French West Africa): 12,000 Tunisia (1914 known as French Tunisia): 2,000 Chad (1914 part of French Equatorial Africa): 1,500 Central African Republic (1914 known as French Oubangui-Chari): 1,000 Niger (1914 part of French West Africa): 1,000 Gabon (1914 part of French Equatorial Africa): 10,500 German colonies The following estimates of deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Erlikman's estimates are based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia. Tanzania (1914 part of German East Africa): 50,000 Namibia (1914 known as German South-West Africa): 1,000 Cameroon (1914 known as Kamerun): 5,000 military and 50,000 Togo (1914 known as German Togoland): 2,000 Rwanda (1914 part of German East Africa): 15,000 Hungary The following estimates of Hungarian deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 385,000: including military losses 270,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 70,000. Civilian dead due to famine and disease were 45,000. Ireland Ireland was a part of the UK during World War I. Five sixths of the island left to form the Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland, in 1922. A total of 206,000 Irishmen served in the British forces during the war. The number of Irish deaths in the British Army recorded by the registrar general was 27,405. A significant number of these casualties were from what, in 1920, became Northern Ireland. While 49,400 soldiers died serving in Irish divisions (the 10th, 16th and 36th), although not all of the men serving in these divisions were natives of Ireland and many Irish who died in non-Irish regiments are not listed. For example, 29% of the casualties in the 16th Division were not natives of Ireland. Neither does it include Irish emigrants in Britain who enlisted there and are not categorised as Irish. Australia lists 4,731 of its first World War soldiers as having been born in Ireland and more than 19,000 Irish-born soldiers served in the Canadian Corps. The rolls do list 30,986 soldiers who were born in Ireland. Prof John Horne of Trinity College Dublin says a figure of between 30,000 and 35,000 Irish war dead is a conservative" estimate and one likely to rise. Mozambique The losses of Portuguese Mozambique were estimated by a Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Erlikman's estimates are based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia. 52,000 Poland Poland was an annexed territory of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia, from 17951918. By late 1915, Germany had complete control over modern-day Poland. A 2005 Polish study estimated 3,376,800 Poles were conscripted into the armed forces of the occupying powers during World War I, an additional 300,000 were conscripted for forced labor by the Germans. The Russians and Austrians forcibly resettled 1.6 to 1.8 million persons from the war zone in Poland. According to Michael Clodfelter, Polish war dead were 1,080,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians were killed in the fighting on the Eastern Front; 870,000 men served in the German, Austrian and Russian armies. Another estimate made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, put total Polish war dead at 640,000, including military losses of 270,000 Poles conscripted, civilian losses of 120,000 due to military operations and 250,000 caused by famine and disease. The ethnic Polish Blue Army served with the French Army. The ethnic Polish Legions fought as part of the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front.

British colonies Britain recruited Indian, Chinese, native South African, Egyptian and other overseas labour to provide logistical support in the combat theatres. Included with British casualties in East Africa are the deaths of 44,911 recruited labourers. The CWGC reports that nearly 2,000 workers from the Chinese Labour Corps are buried with British war dead in France. The following estimates of British Empire colonial military deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian journalist Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century.

Nepal During WW1, the Nepalese army was expanded and six new regiments, totaling more than 20,000 troopsall volunteerswere sent to India, most of them to the North-West Frontier Province, to release British and Indian troops for service overseas. Simultaneously, the Nepalese government agreed to maintain recruitment at a level that would sustain the existing British Gurkha units and allow the establishment of additional ones. The battalions were increased to thirty-three with the addition of 55,000 new recruits and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command for service on all fronts. Many volunteers were assigned to non-combat units, such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions but they also were in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia. The Rana prime ministers urged Nepalese males to fight in the war. Of the more than 200,000 Nepalese who served in the British army, there were some 20,000 Gurkha casualties included above with the British Indian Army. ^a East Africa The conflict in East Africa caused enormous civilian casualties. The Oxford History of World War One notes that "In east and central Africa the harshness of the war resulted in acute shortages of food with famine in some areas, a weakening of populations, and epidemic diseases which killed hundreds of thousands of people and also cattle." The following estimates of civilian deaths in East Africa during World War I were made by a Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century: Kenya 30,000; Tanzania 100,000; Mozambique 50,000; Rwanda 15,000; Burundi 20,000 and the Belgian Congo 150,000.

(626,440 killed in action, 17,174 died of wounds, 228,838 missing, 3,409,433 held as prisoners of war and 2,754,202 wounded in action). Urlanis believes that the figures for those killed were considerably underestimated, because a large part of the reports were lost in retreats. Urlanis estimated the actual total military war dead at 1,811,000 (killed 1,200,000, died of wounds 240,000, gassed 11,000, died from disease 155,000, POW deaths 190,000, deaths due to accidents and other causes 15,000). A study by the Russian military historian G.F. Krivosheev estimated the total war dead at 2,254,369 (killed in action 1,200,000; missing and presumed dead 439,369; died of wounds 240,000, gassed 11,000, died from disease 155,000, POW deaths 190,000, deaths due to accidents and other causes 19,000). Wounded 3,749,000. POW 3,343,900. Total mobilized force 15,378,000. United States War Dept. figures for Russian casualties are: Total mobilized force 12,000,000. Total casualties 9,150,000 (including Killed and died 1,700,000, wounded 4,950,000, prisoners and missing 2,500,000). The U.K. War Office Based on a telegram from Petrograd to Copenhagen of 28 December 1918 listed military casualties of 9,150,000 (including 1,700,000 killed, 1,450,000 disabled, 3,500,000 wounded and 2,500,000 POW). In 1924, the Soviet government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported for Russia 15,070,000 men mobilized and 1,700,000 dead and missing in World War I. According to the Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis there were 1,500,000 civilian deaths due to wartime privations up until the end of 1917. A Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century estimated 1,140,000 war related Russian civilian deaths, from 19141917 in 1914 borders (410,000 due to military operations and 730,000 caused by famine and disease). ^q Serbia Sources for total Serbian casualties range from 750,000 to 1,250,000. A demographic study in 1927, put total the war dead for Serbia and Montenegro at 750,000 (300,000 military and 450,000 civilians). The overall population loss from 19121920, based on the pre-war level was 1,236,000 persons (including 750,000 in World War I; 150,000 killed in the Balkan Wars and a decline in the number of births of 336,000), in addition there were 47,000 war related deaths during 19141920, that are included with deaths by natural causes. According to Frdric Le Moal, Serbian historian Duan T. Batakovi puts their losses at 1,250,000 (450,000 military and 800,000 civilians). These losses are from 19121918 and include the Balkan Wars. In July 2014, Serbian poet and academic Matija Bekovi said "that 402,435 Serbian soldiers have been killed and 845,000 civilians hanged or exterminated in concentration camps during WWI. At a September 2014 conference sponsored by the Serbian Ministry of Defense, Dr. Alexander Nedok put Serbian war dead at 1,247,435 persons. According to the Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis regarding Serbia "it is particularly difficult to ascertain the number of killed". Based on a demographic analysis of the population, Urlanis estimated total Serbian and Montenegrin casualties of 728,000 including military dead: 278,000 (140,000 killed in action; 25,000 died of wounds; 50,000 disease; 60,000 POW and 3,000 from other causes) and total civilian dead of 450,000. In 1924, the Serbian government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 1,008,240 men mobilized and 365,164 dead and missing in World War I. United States War Dept. figures for Serbian casualties are: total mobilized force 707,343; total casualties 331,106 (including killed and died 45,000; wounded 133,148; prisoners and missing 152,958). The report of the U.K. War Office listed military casualties of 331,106 including 45,000 killed, 133,148 wounded and 70,243 prisoners and 82,535 missing. A Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, estimated 120,000 Serbian civilian deaths due to military activity and 30,000 in Austro-Hungarian prisons. His estimate for total Yugoslav civilian casualties including Austro-Hungarian territory was 550,000. ^r South Africa The Commonwealth War Graves Commission figure for South Africa war dead is 9,592. The report of the U.K. War Office listed 7,121 Army war dead, 12,029 wounded and 1,538 taken prisoner. In 1924, the South African government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 136,070 men mobilized and 7,134 dead and missing in World War I. The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total South African military deaths are 5,000 killed and died of wounds. ^s United Kingdom Sources for U.K. casualties are divergent and contradictory, there are four published figures for army deaths. One: official figures issued by the British Army in 1921 put their losses at about 673,000 dead and missing from all causes in combat theaters. Two: the summary in the 1922 report of the War Office put army and Royal Naval Division dead at 702,410. The authors of the War Office report did not explain the difference between their figures and the official figures issued in 1921 by the British army, however the difference is more than likely due to the inclusion of the Royal Naval Division and deaths outside of combat theaters. Three: the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database available online identifies by name 758,000 army dead, not including the Royal Naval Division. Four: An unofficial compilation of the names of the Army war dead was published by Naval and Military Press in 1998, that put British Army war dead at over 703,000. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 2014 listed 887,711 war dead for the U.K. and Colonies. This figure also includes the British Mercantile Marine and conscripted civilian laborers from Africa and Asia. According to The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, their statistics are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women whose death was attributable to their war service, they do not list the cause of death for these casualties. They do not breakout U.K. losses between the British Isles and the various colonies. The website of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database lists the names of many of the U.K. war dead. Access to the database is open to the general public free of charge. These figures include deaths of forces from the U.K. and Colonies excluding the Dominions and include deaths that occurred after the war up until 31 August 1921. The CWGC figures include military dead outside of combat theaters and civilian workers conscripted outside of the U.K. in British military service. In 1924, the U.K. government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 5,704,416 men mobilized and 743,702 dead and missing in World War I. The report of the U.K. War Office listed a summary figures from 4 Aug. 1914 up until 31 Dec. 1920 for the army from the British Isles, not including other colonies of 702,410 war dead, 1,662,625 wounded and 170,389 taken prisoner of war. The War Office report lists those "killed in action; died of wounds; died as prisoners of war and missing officers and other ranks whose deaths have been accepted for official purposes". According to the report these figures include the casualties of the army and the Royal Naval Division. Reported separately were Royal Navy casualties of 32,287 dead and missing and 5,135 wounded. These figures do not include an additional 14,661 British Mercantile Marine dead. The casualties from the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force and Royal Naval Air Service for 191418 totaled 6,166 killed, 3,212 missing and 7,245 wounded. The figures for the Royal Naval Division were 7,547 killed and 2,584 died of wounds. A compilation published by the authority of the War Office in 192021 Soldiers died in the great war, 19141919, listed war 673,000 Army war dead, not including the Royal Flying Corps. The official "final and corrected" casualty figures for British army, including the Territorial Force, were issued on 10 March 1921, in a British parliamentary report. The losses were for the period 4 August 1914 until 30 September 1919, included 573,507 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 254,176 missing and prisoners less 154,308 released prisoners; for a net total of 673,375 dead and missing. There were 1,643,469 wounded also listed in the report. The details by theater of war: France- 510,821 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 1,524,332 wounded and 236,573 missing (including prisoners). Italy- 2,081 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 4,689 wounded and 344 missing (including prisoners). Dardanelles- 16,688 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes", 47,128 wounded and 7,525 missing (including prisoners). Salonika- 9,668 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes", 16,637 wounded and 2,778 missing (including prisoners). Mesopotamia- 15,230 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 19,449 wounded and 3,581 missing (including prisoners). Egypt- 14,763 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 29,434 wounded and 2,951 missing (including prisoners). East Africa- 1,269 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 534 wounded and 62 missing (including prisoners). Afghanistan- 120 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 152 wounded and 2 missing (including prisoners). Russia- 359 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 453 wounded and 143 missing (including prisoners). Other Theaters- 508 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 461 wounded and 217 missing (including prisoners). United States War Dept. figures for total British Empire casualties including the U.K. were: total mobilized force 8,904,467; total casualties 3,190,255 (including killed and died: 908,371; wounded: 2,090,212; prisoners and missing 191,652). The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total U.K. military deaths are 624,000 killed or missing in action and died of wounds. According to a demographic study, there were 292,000 indirect deaths in the U.K. (109,000 deaths due to wartime privations and 183,000 in the Spanish Flu pandemic). Another estimate of the demographic loss of the civilian population in the U.K. during the war, put total excess deaths at 181,000 not including an additional 100,000 Spanish Flu deaths. The 1922 War Office report detailed the deaths of 1,260 civilians and 310 military personnel due to air and sea bombardment of the U.K. Losses at sea were 908 U.K. civilians and 63 fisherman killed in U-Boat attacks. Overseas labor units serving with the British and French forces. The U.K. employed about 300,000 Indian, Chinese, native South African, Egyptian and other nations as laborers during the war. By the end of 1917, there were 50,000 Chinese workers in France, rising to 96,000 by August 1918 (with another 30,000 working for the French). 100,000 Egyptians were working in France and the Middle East, alongside 21,000 Indians and 20,000 South Africans, who were also in East Africa. A total of about 140,000 Chinese workers recruited in the Beiyang government, served on the Western Front during and after the war with the British and French Armed Forces. According to the Commonwealth war Graves Commission "In all, nearly 2,000 men from the Chinese Labour Corps died during the First World War, some as a direct result of enemy action, or of wounds received in the course of their duties, but many more in the influenza epidemic that swept Europe in 191819" One historical controversy is the number who died in the war. Some Chinese scholars say the number was as high as 20,000 but records kept by the British and French recruiters, show just under 2,000 lost their lives, many from the flu pandemic that swept the world starting in 1919. According to the Commonwealrh War Graves Commission, "The African combatant troops raised for the East African campaign numbered 34,000. The non-combatant porters, stevedores and followers of the Military Labour Corps 600,000. Almost 50,000 of these men were lost, killed in action died of sickness or wounds" ^t United States US Dept. of Defense figures from 2010, list 116,516 war dead from all causes for the period ending Dec. 31, 1918, including 106,378 in the Army, 7,287 in the Navy and 2,851 in the Marine Corps. There were 53,402 battle deaths, including 50,510 in the Army, 431 in the navy and 2,461 in the Marines. There were 63,114 non-combat deaths, 55,868 in the Army, 6,856 in the Navy and 390 in the Marines. Wounded: 204,200 (Army: 193,663, Navy: 819, Marines: 9,520). The figures include 279 deaths during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War from 19181920. The U.S. casualty figures were revised by the US Dept. of Defense in 1957. The US Coast Guard lost 192 dead (111 deaths in action and 81 from other causes). United States War Dept. figures from 1924 for U.S. casualties were: total mobilized force 4,355,000; total casualties 350,300 (including killed and died from all causes 126,000; wounded 234,300 (including 14,500 died of wounds); prisoners and missing 4,500). In 1924, the U.S. government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 4,272,521 men mobilized and 67,813 dead and missing in World War I. United States civilian losses include 128 killed in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania as well as 629 Merchant Mariners killed in enemy submarine attacks on their merchant ships. ^u Austria-Hungary The official history of Austria-Hungary's involvement in the First World War put total military dead at 1,494,200:(1,016,200 killed and 478,000 while prisoners of war). In 1924, the Austrian government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 9,000,000 men mobilized and 1,542,817 dead and missing in World War I. United States War Dept. figures for Austro-Hungarian casualties are: total mobilized force 7,800,000; total casualties 7,020,000 (including killed and died 1,200,000; wounded 3,620,000; prisoners and missing 2,200,000). The U.K. War Office estimate for Austro-Hungarian casualties up to 31 December 1918: total casualties of 7,020,000 including 1,200,000 killed, 3,620,000 wounded and 2,200,000 prisoners. The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total Austro-Hungarian military deaths are 900,000 killed and died of wounds. A study published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace estimated that there were 467,000 civilian deaths attributable to wartime privations caused by the allied blockade. A Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century estimated 120,000 civilian deaths due to military activity in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. ^v Bulgaria: United States War Dept. figures for Bulgarian casualties are: total mobilized force 1,200,000; total casualties 266,919 (including Killed and died 87,500; wounded 152,930; Prisoners and missing 27,029). The U.K. War Office listed casualties reported by the Bulgarian War Office: 87,500 total dead (48,917 killed, 13,198 died of wounds, 888? accidentally killed, 24,497 died of disease); 13,729 missing; 152,390 wounded and 10,623 prisoners. The Bulgarian War Office stated that "losses during the retreat from sickness and privations were much greater than the figures they possess". In 1924, the Bulgarian government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 400,000 men mobilized and 32,772 dead and missing in World War I. The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total Bulgarian military deaths are 62,000 killed and died of wounds. According to the Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis there were 100,000 civilian deaths due to wartime privations. ^w German Empire In 1934 the official German war history listed 2,037,000 military dead. Confirmed dead from all causes 1,936,897 (Army 1,900,876, Navy 34,836, Colonial troops 1,185); wounded 4,215,662; prisoners and missing 974,977 of which an estimated 100,000 were presumed dead.- United States War Dept. figures for German casualties are: total mobilized force 11,000,000; total casualties 7,142,558 (including Killed and died 1,773,700; wounded 4,216,058; prisoners and missing 1,152,800). The U.K. War Office listed official German figures from 1921 of 1,808,545 killed and 4,247,143 wounded, exclusive of 14,000 African conscript deaths during the war. In 1924, the German government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 13,250,000 men mobilized and 2,000,000 dead and missing in World War I. The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total German military deaths are 1,796,000 killed and died of wounds. The U.K. War Office listed official German figures from 1919 of 720 German civilians who were killed by allied air raids. The figures for civilian deaths due to the Blockade of Germany are disputed. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 maintained that 763,000 German civilians died from malnutrition and disease caused by the blockade up until the end of December 1918. A German academic study in 1928 put the death toll at 424,000. A study sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1940, estimated the German civilian death toll due to the war at over 600,000. Based on the above-mentioned German study of 1928, they maintained that "A thorough inquiry has led to the conclusion that the number of "civilian" deaths traceable to the war was 424,000, to which number must be added about 200,000 deaths caused by the influenza epidemic". ^x Ottoman Empire: Based on his analysis of the non-published individual World War I campaign histories in the Ottoman Archives, Edward J. Erickson estimated Ottoman military casualties in the study Ordered to Die: A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War. The casualties included total war dead of 771,844, (243,598 killed in action, 61,487 missing action and 466,759 deaths due to disease). The number of wounded was 763,753 and POWs 145,104. The Ottoman official casualty statistics published in 1922 were: total dead 325,000 including (killed in action 50,000, 35,000 died of wounds, 240,000 died of disease). Wounded 400,000. POWs, sick and missing 1,565,000 and total mobilized: 2,850,000. United States War Dept. figures for Ottoman casualties are: total mobilized force 2,850,000; total casualties 975,000 (including killed and died 325,000; wounded 400,000; prisoners and missing 250,000). The U.K. War Office figures for Ottoman casualties were: total accounted for 725,000 (killed 50,000, died of wounds 35,000, died of disease 400,000, wounded 400,000). Total unaccounted for: 1,565,000 (prisoners, deserters, invalids and missing). The Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that included in total Ottoman military deaths are 318,000 killed and died of wounds. Estimates of Ottoman civilian casualties range from 2,000,000 to 2,150,000. Civilian casualties include the Armenian Genocide. The total number of resulting Armenian deaths is generally held to have been 1.5 million. Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks. Some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination. Turkish spokesmen maintain that reports of Armenian massacres were one sided and distorted work of wartime propaganda. The government of Turkey has consistently rejected charges of genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine or disease during World War I. A Russian journalist in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, estimated 1,000,000 war related civilian deaths in the Ottoman Empire due to famine and disease. ^y Denmark Denmark was neutral in the war but Germany at that time included part of Danish Schleswig. Men from this area were conscripted into the German forces and their losses are included with German casualties. Over 700 Danish merchant sailors and fisherman died, mostly due to vessels torpedoed by German submarines. ^j Luxembourg Luxembourg remained under German occupation during the war. The government, led by Paul Eyschen, chose to remain neutral. This strategy had the approval of Marie-Adlade, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Some citizens were conscripted into the German forces and others escaped to volunteer for the Allies. According to the Mobile Reference travel Guide, 3,700 Luxembourgeois citizens served in the French armed forces and 2,800 gave their lives in the war. They are commemorated at the Glle Fra in Luxembourg. ^z Norway Norway was neutral in the war but lost ships and merchant sailors in trading through the war zones. In 1924, the Norwegian government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 1,180 persons dead and missing in World War I. ^az Sweden Sweden was neutral in the war but lost ships and merchant sailors in trading through the war zones. In 1924, the Swedish government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 800 persons dead and missing in World War I. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) Annual Report 20132014 provides current statistics on the military dead for the British Empire. The war dead totals listed in the report are based on the research by the CWGC to identify and commemorate Commonwealth war dead. The statistics tabulated by The Commonwealth War Graves Commission are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth and former UK Dependencies, whose death was attributable to their war service. Some auxiliary and civilian organizations are also accorded war grave status if death occurred under certain specified conditions. For the purposes of CWGC the dates of inclusion for Commonwealth War Dead are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921. Total World War I dead were 1,116,371 (UK and former colonies 887,711; Undivided India 73,895; Canada 64,997; Australia 62,123; New Zealand 18,053; South Africa 9,592). The Commonwealth War Graves Commission figures also include the Merchant Navy. Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 19141920, The War Office March 1922. This official report lists Army casualties (including Royal Naval Division) of 908,371 killed in action, died of wounds, died as prisoners of war and were missing in action from 4 August 1914 to 31 December 1920, (British Isles 702,410; India 64,449; Canada 56,639; Australia 59,330; New Zealand 16,711; South Africa 7,121 and Newfoundland 1,204, other colonies 507). Figures of the Royal Navy war dead and missing of 32,287 were listed separately. These figures do not include the Merchant Navy dead of 14,661. The losses of France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Greece, Russia, the USA, Bulgaria, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey were also listed in the UK War Office report. The official "final and corrected" casualty figures for British Army,including the Territorial Force (not including allied British Empire forces) were issued on 10 March 1921. The losses were for the period 4 August 1914 until 30 September 1919, included 573,507 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 254,176 missing less 154,308 released prisoners; for a net total of 673,375 dead and missing. There were 1,643,469 wounded also listed in the report. Sources for British Empire casualties are divergent and contradictory. The report of the War Office published in 1922 put the total number of British Empire "soldiers who lost their lives" at 908,371. On a separate schedule the War Office listed the losses of the Royal Navy at 32,237 dead and missing. It is implicit in this presentation that the figures for "soldiers who lost their lives" do not include the Royal Navy. However many published reference works list total British Empire(including the Dominions) losses at 908,371, it is implicit in these presentations that the figures for total losses include the Royal Navy. The War Office report puts the number of "soldiers who lost their lives" from the British Regular Army and Royal Naval Division at 702,410. This is not in agreement with the "final and corrected" figures in the 1921 report for the army published in the General Annual Report of the British Army 19121919, which put British Army dead and missing at 673,375 and the official compilation of Army war dead published in 1921 that put total losses at about 673,000. The War Office report did not explain the reason for this discrepancy; the difference is more than likely due to their inclusion of the Royal Naval Division and deaths outside of combat theaters. Casualties and Medical Statistics published in 1931. was the final volume of the Official Medical History of the War, gives British Empire, including the Dominions, for Army losses by cause of death. Total war dead in combat theaters from 1914 to 1918 were 876,084, which included 418,361 killed, 167,172 died of wounds, 113,173 died of disease or injury, 161,046 missing and presumed dead and 16,332 prisoner of war deaths. Also listed were 2,004,976 wounded and 6,074,552 sick and injured. Total losses were not broken out for the UK and each Dominion, the figures are for losses in combat theaters only and do not include casualties of forces stationed in the U.K from accidents or disease, casualties of the Royal Naval Division are also not included in these figures; the losses of the Gallipoli Campaign are for British forces only, since records for Dominion forces were incomplete. Figures do not include the Royal Navy. Military CasualtiesWorld WarEstimated," Statistics Branch, General Staff, U.S. War Department, 25 February 1924.
