The EGP-6 reactors are a scaled down version of the RBMK reactor design. Notably, these reactors along with the RBMK designs are some of the few active reactors which still use ordinary (light) water cooled graphite as a neutron moderator. The only operating reactors of this type exist at the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant, commissioned in 1974. The plant design was developed by the Ural Division of Teploelektroproekt together with Izhorskiye Zavody and FEI in Obninsk. It is the world's smallest commercial nuclear reactor.
