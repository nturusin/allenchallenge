Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) include a number of separate idiopathic disorders which affect different parts of the gastrointestinal tract and involve visceral hypersensitivity and impaired gastrointestinal motility. Heightened mast cell activation is a common factor among all FGIDs that contributes to visceral hypersensitivity as well as epithelial, neuromuscular, and motility dysfunction. The Rome process has helped to define the functional gastrointestinal disorders. Successively, the Rome I, Rome II, and the Rome III meetings have proposed a consensual classification system and terminology, as recommended by the Rome Coordinating Committee.
