Any subset R of the integers is called a reduced residue system modulo n if gcd(r, n) = 1 for each r contained in R; R contains (n) elements; no two elements of R are congruent modulo n. Here denotes Euler's totient function. A reduced residue system modulo n can be formed from a complete residue system modulo n by removing all integers not relatively prime to n. For example, a complete residue system modulo 12 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. 1, 5, 7 and 11 are the only integers in this set which are relatively prime to 12, and so the corresponding reduced residue system modulo 12 is {1,5,7,11}. The cardinality of this set can be calculated with the totient function: . Some other reduced residue systems modulo 12 are: {13,17,19,23} {11,7,5,1} {7,13,13,31} {35,43,53,61} If {r1, r2, ... , r(n)} is a reduced residue system with n > 2, then . Every number in a reduced residue system mod n is a generator for the additive group of integers modulo n.
