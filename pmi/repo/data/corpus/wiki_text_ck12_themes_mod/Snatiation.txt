Snatiation is a medical disorder characterized by uncontrollable bursts of sneezing brought on by fullness of the stomach, and typically observed in sufferers immediately after a large meal. It is thought to be passed along genetically as an autosomal dominant trait. The phenomenon was first described by Ahmad Teebi and Qasem Al-Saleh in 1989. The term "SNATIATION" was coined shortly thereafter by Judith G. Hall. The term is a portmanteau of the words sneeze and satiation. Its backronym holds that it stands for Sneezing Non-controllably At a Time of Indulgence of the Appetitea Trait Inherited and Ordained to be Named. A related disorder, gustatory rhinitis, can cause some individuals to sneeze after eating lesser amounts, particularly after the consumption of spicy foods.
