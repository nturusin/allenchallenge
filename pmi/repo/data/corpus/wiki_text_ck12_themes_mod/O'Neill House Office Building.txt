The O'Neill House Office Building was a congressional office building located near the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Initially known as "House Annex-1", it was named in the late 1980s after former Speaker of the House Thomas "Tip" O'Neill. In the 1970s, two buildings were acquired by the Architect of the Capitol to be used as office space by the House of Representatives. One of the buildings acquired was the Ford House Office Building, originally built to house the fingerprint records of Federal Bureau of Investigation. The other, the O'Neill House Office Building, originally the Congressional Hotel, was located on C Street. When it was turned into a House Office Building, the third and fourth floors of the building were retained as residences to be used as the House Page dormitory. The building was demolished in 2002. A parking lot is currently on the site. [1]
