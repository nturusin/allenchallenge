Ellobiopsis is a genus of alveolae parasitic protozoa. This genus was created in 1910 by Caullery. Species in this genus infect crustaceans. The type species is Ellobiopsis chattoni. This genus has been difficult to classify, being placed in several different taxa in the past (e.g., Chytridiomycota, Dinoflagellata) but it is now known to be an alveolate. Its closest relations appear to be the genus Thalassomyces. These genera have been grouped together to form the family Ellobiopsidae.
