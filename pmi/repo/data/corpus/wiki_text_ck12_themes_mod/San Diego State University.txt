San Diego State University (SDSU, State) is a public research university in San Diego, and is the largest and oldest higher education institution in San Diego County. Founded in 1897 as San Diego Normal School, it is the third-oldest university in the 23-member California State University (CSU). SDSU has a student body of more than 35,000 and an alumni base of more than 280,000. The Carnegie Foundation has designated San Diego State University a "Research University with high research activity," placing it among the top 200 higher education institutions in the country conducting research. In the 200910 academic year, the university obtained $150 million for research, including $26 million from the National Institutes of Health. The university soon expects to be classified as "Doctoral/Research-Extensive". As reported by the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index (FSP Index) released by the Academic Analytics organization of Stony Brook, New York, SDSU is the number one small research university in the United States for four academic years in a row. SDSU sponsors the second highest number of Fulbright Scholars in the state of California, just behind UC Berkeley. Since 2005, the university has produced over 65 Fulbright student scholars. The university generates over $2.4 billion annually for the San Diego economy, while 60 percent of SDSU graduates remain in San Diego, making SDSU a primary educator of the region's work force. Committed to serving the diverse San Diego region, SDSU ranks among the top ten universities nationwide in terms of ethnic and racial diversity among its student body, as well as the number of bachelor's degrees conferred upon minority students. San Diego State University is a member of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU), the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and the Southwest Border Security Consortium. Established on March 13, 1897, San Diego State University first began as the San Diego Normal School, meant to educate local women as elementary school teachers. It was located on a 17-acre (6.9 ha) campus on Park Boulevard in University Heights (now the headquarters of the San Diego Unified School District). It opened with seven faculty members and 91 students; the curriculum was initially limited to English, history and mathematics. In 1923, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College, "a four-year public institution controlled by the state Board of Education". By the 1930s the school had outgrown its original campus. In 1931 it moved to its current location on a mesa at what was then the eastern edge of San Diego. In 1935, the school expanded its offerings beyond teacher education and became San Diego State College. In 1960, San Diego State College became a part of the California State Colleges system, now known as The California State University. Finally in 1972 San Diego State College became California State University, San Diego, and in 1974 San Diego State University (SDSU). John F. Kennedy, then the President of the United States of America, gave the graduation commencement address at San Diego State University on June 6, 1963. Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making SDSU the first California State College to award an honorary doctorate. In 1964, this event was registered as California Historical Landmark #798. On May 29, 1964, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. addressed a near-capacity audience in the Open Air Theater. King discussed his vision for the future and called for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, then being debated in the Senate. Since 1968, SDSU's Astronomy Department has owned the Mount Laguna Observatory located in the Cleveland National Forest. It operates the observatory concurrently with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In April 2012, his Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama spoke at SDSU's Viejas Arena as part of his "Compassion Without Borders" tour. SDSU has had 10 presidents, two of whom served in an acting capacity. Several structures on the campus are named in past presidents' honor, such as Hardy Tower, Hepner Hall (integrated in the university's logo), and the Malcolm A. Love Library. Samuel T. Black (18981910) Edward L. Hardy (191035) Walter R. Hepner (193552) Malcolm A. Love (195271) Donald E. Walker (197172, Acting) Brage Golding (197277) Trevor Colbourn (197778, Acting) Thomas B. Day (197896) Stephen L. Weber (19962011) Elliot Hirshman (2011 to present) The university awards 189 types of bachelor's degrees, 91 different master's degrees, 25 doctoral degrees including EdD, DPT, JD, AuD, DNP, and PhD programs in collaboration with other universities. SDSU also offers 26 different teaching credentials. The university offers more doctoral degrees than any other campus in the entire California State University, while also enrolling the largest student body of doctoral students in the system. In 2015, SDSU enrolled the most doctoral students in its entire history. Several buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Scripps Cottage was finished in September 1931, funded with a donation of $6,000 from Ellen Browning Scripps matched with $5,000 from the state. It was the headquarters for the Associated Women Students and was used for meetings, women's activities, and served as a lounge. On September 3, 1968, the building was moved to make room for the new school. It was used mainly as a conference and meeting building, and in 1993, began serving as a center for international students. Aztec Bowl, costing $500,000, the stadium was dedicated on October 3, 1936, before 7,500 people, after being completed earlier that year. The stadium was initially supposed to be expanded to 45,000 seats, but instead was only expanded once with 5,000 seats in 1948. Aztec Bowl has been erroneously described as the only state college stadium in California at the time of its construction, but at the time San Jose State University's Spartan Stadium was already three years old. Open Air Theatre contained 4,280 seats and was financed by the Works Progress Administration and the state for $200,000. It was dedicated in 1941. On January 19, 1976, the Montezuma Mesa building was renamed to Walter R. Hepner Hall, and on May 1, 1977, the Humanities building was named after John Adams, a professor, administrator, and archivist. The Humanities-Social Sciences building was renamed in 1986 after geographer Alvena Storm and historian Abraham P. Nasatir. In the 1980s the Open Air Theatre added support facilities. Peterson Gym was finished in 1961, making the original gym the Womens Gym until it was remodeled and reopened in 1990 as the Physical Education building. In 1990, 14,000 sq ft (1,300 m2) were added to Storm and Nasatir Halls. In 1986, a large student apartment complex was added along with an 11-story $13,000,000 residence hall (west side of campus). Hardy Memorial Tower, in the Mission Revival style, resembles a Spanish bell tower and is one of the most recognizable buildings on campus. It houses the campanile chimes but also originally concealed a 5000-gallon water tank for the campus plumbing system. The building housed the university's first library, which featured murals painted by the Works Progress Administration. The WPA Mission Revival Communication building, Exercise and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty-Staff Club, Life Science building and Annex, Little Theatre, Physical Plant Boiler Shop, and the Physical Science building are also listed on the National Register. Other buildings on campus include: The campus library, now known as the Malcolm A. Love Library, acquired its 100,000th book on May 21, 1944. By the end of World War II it was adding about 8,000 books a year. In 1959, a 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m2). addition to the library was finished, but it was already deemed too small. In 1952, the library had 125,000 books, and state regulations required that old books be eliminated before new ones could be added. By 1965, there were more than 300,000 books housed in a library that could hold 230,000. This was ranked highest in state colleges in terms of library size. In the 1960s, construction of a new library began, which required the relocation of Scripps Cottage. The $8,000,000 building was designed with 300,000 sq ft (28,000 m2). of space to accommodate one million books. In February 1971, the library opened, housing 700,000 books, and was named after President Malcolm A. Love for his popularity on campus and his role in bringing State to university status. Governor Ronald Reagan said the library would ". . . serve as a lasting memorial to the man who led the college through its growing pains . . . to one of the finest state colleges in California". The building was five stories high and was the largest building on campus. A four-story sculpture entitled "Hanging Discus" by sculptor George Baker was specifically designed for the library and added to an interior staircase in November 1973. The Conrad Prebys Aztec Student Union Student Union (formerly Aztec Center) secured financing in 2010 and was completed in March 2014, replacing and approximately doubling the size of the Student Union. The facility is the first student union in the United States to qualify for LEED Platinum distinction. The $11 million Parma Payne Goodall Alumni Center opened in October 2009 and is home to the SDSU Alumni Association and the Campanile Foundation. In 2014, SDSU opened the newly renovated social sciences complex, Storm and Nasatir Halls. Originally built in 1957, the 137,700 square foot complex received a complete makeover to house eight academic departments from the College of Arts & Letters, newly upgraded classrooms and faculty offices, academic research facilities, two large lecture halls, and a food service facility. Total cost for the construction neared $74 million, and began in 2012. Included in the opening were two new named facilities: Charles Hostler Hall (a 435-seat lecture auditorium) and the J. Keith Behner and Catherine M. Stiefel Auditorium (a 252-seat lecture hall). Storm Hall was named in honor of geography professor Alvena Storm, who served on the faculty for over 40 years since 1926. Nasatir Hall was named for Abraham P. Nasatir, a professor emeritus of history who taught at SDSU for 46 years (192874) and was later internationally recognized for his research on California history, receiving four Fulbright Fellowships. In 1937, Quetzal Hall, the first dormitory, opened for 40 women students and was located off campus. In 1952, 50 college males conducted a panty raid at Quetzal Hall, causing $1,000 in damages. Police arrested 13 of the students and the young women later retaliated by attacking the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. In 1968, the coed dorm Zura Hall was built, and more rooms were added later. Chapultepec Hall held 580 students when first built. Today, the university owns and operates housing for over 4,100 students in residence halls and student apartments, fraternity row, and language and honors housing. Approximately 63 percent of first-time freshman live in on-campus housing, while about 14 percent of the overall student body resides in on campus housing. SDSU offers themed living communities in the freshman and upperclassman housing, such as "pathways for transfers", "gender-neutral housing", and "explore San Diego". SDSU operates a branch campus, the Imperial Valley Campus (IVC) located in Calexico, California, with an additional campus in Brawley, California. IVC includes a research park and related facilities. The campus originally served only upper division, teacher certification, and graduate students but now serves a selective cohort of freshmen and sophomores pursuing degrees in criminal justice, liberal studies, or psychology. SDSU formerly operated a campus in North County, which was later converted into the larger California State University San Marcos. In the South Bay, SDSU operated a campus in National City, California. This campus shared facilities with Southwestern College. The South Bay Campus is now closed indefinitely. San Diego State University is consistently one of the most applied-to universities within the California State University system (surpassed only by Long Beach), receiving 76,688 undergraduate applications (including transfer and first time freshman) for the Fall 2014 semester and accepted 23,832 for an admission rate of about 31.1 percent across the university. Furthermore, SDSU received 21,767 applications for transfer admission (having 60 or more units) and accepted 4,207 for a transfer admission rate of 19.3 percent. SDSU is one of the most selective campuses in The California State University system. For fall 2010, SDSU had the lowest admission rate in the CSU system at 30.0 percent. In fall 2013, SDSU had the third-lowest admission rate in the CSU (37.2 percent), behind CSU Long Beach (35.5 percent) and Cal Poly (34.5 percent). SDSU's average SAT score of incoming freshmen was the second highest in the CSU for fall 2013 at 1106 (out of 1600; the writing section is not considered), with the average high school GPA also the second highest at 3.61. The university reached its peak enrollment in 1987 with a student body of 35,945 FTES (Full-Time Equivalent Students), which made it at the time the largest university in California and the 10th largest university in the United States. Due to the overwhelming number of students and lack of facilities and majors, The California State University Board of Trustees voted to cap enrollment for SDSU at 33,000. However, in 1993 enrollment dropped to 26,800 (the lowest since 1973) due to a financial crisis. Nonetheless, enrollment has fluctuated through the years and rose back to nearly 35,000 (exceeding the cap) in 2008. For the spring 2015 semester, the university had a total enrollment of 28,473 FTESapproximately 25,000 undergraduate and 4,000 postgraduatemaking it one of the largest research universities in the state of California. In fall 2013, SDSU had the most doctoral students enrolled in its history at 534 students, also the highest amount of doctorate-seeking students enrolled across the 23-campus CSU system. From 2006 to 2010, SDSU was ranked the No. 1 most productive research university among schools with 14 or fewer PhD programs based on the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index. The school has since exceeded the "small research" limit with 17 PhD programs, in addition to six professional doctorates. SDSU has been designated a "Research University" with high research activity by the Carnegie Foundation. Since 2000, SDSU faculty and staff have attracted more than $1.5 billion in grants and contracts for research and program administration. As a result, U.S. News & World Report classifies San Diego State University as a "National University", whereas all other 22 campuses in The California State University system are classified as "Regional Universities". SDSU is the highest enrolled university in the San Diego metropolitan area. One in seven adults in San Diego who holds a college degree attended SDSU. In 2013, SDSU was lauded for its comprehensive endowment campaign efforts, which raised over $400 million from 2007 to 2013. The Council for Advancement and Support of Education recognized SDSU for its overall performance in fundraising efforts. San Diego State was ranked the 28th top college in the United States by Payscale and CollegeNet's Social Mobility Index college rankings. Money Magazine ranked San Diego State 116th in the country out of over 700 schools it evaluated for its 2015 Best Colleges ranking. The Daily Beast ranked San Diego State 75th in the country out of the nearly 2,000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking.

An auxiliary to The Campanile Foundation is the Aztec Athletic Association, which primarily raises funds for the student athletes in the San Diego State University athletics programs (see discussion of Athletics below and at SDSU Aztecs). The university currently recognizes 19 social fraternities, 17 social sororities, and 16 business/professional/service fraternities for a total of 52 Greek organizations on campus. On April 27, 1974, The Phi Beta Kappa Society established an SDSU chapter. It was the first in the CSU system as well as the San Diego area. Other multidisciplinary national honor societies include Phi Kappa Phi, Mortar Board, Golden Key, and Phi Eta Sigma. The first fraternity on campus was the Delta chapter of Epsilon Eta, which formed on October 25, 1921. By the end of the decade there were six other fraternities and eight sororities. The fraternities and sororities were all local and did not attain national status until after World War II. In 1925, in order to encourage higher grades, the Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-Sorority Council published the average grades of the fraternity and sorority members. On a 3.0 scale, the average GPA (grade point average) for all students was 1.49, for fraternities was 1.35, and sororities was 1.47. By the mid-1930s there were eight fraternities and eleven sororities, and later expanded to fifteen fraternities and twelve sororities in the 1940s. The first fraternity to go national was Theta Chi and the first sorority was Alpha Xi Delta. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the Greek population had dwindled to 699, but gradually began to increase in the 1980s, reaching 2,900 in 1988. There were 20 fraternities and 13 sororities officially affiliated with the Inter Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Council as well as six independent fraternities/sororities. This made it one of the largest fraternity and sorority systems in the western U.S. On April 6, 1978, Gamma Phi Beta sorority hired a plane to drop marshmallows on fraternity houses during Derby Week, but the plane crashed near Peterson Gym, injuring four students aboard. After, a 1983 USA Today article reported that SDSU Greeks' GPAs were below the campus average, SDSU tightened restrictions and supervision, and by 1989 their grades had increased to slightly above the university average. Between 1989 and 1991, several riots among the fraternities occurred, including one numbering 3,500 people and another requiring 34 police officers to end it. The 2008 drug bust resulted in the suspension of several fraternities as well as the arrests of multiple fraternity members. Currently there are over 50 social fraternities and sororities, including general, professional, and culturally based organizations represented by five governing councils. The Panhellenic council sororities on campus include Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Phi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Delta, and Pi Beta Phi. The IFC council includes Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Upsilon, Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau.

The NPHC council includes Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma fraternity, and Delta Sigma Theta sorority. The Professional Fraternity Council (PFC) includes Alpha Kappa Psi, Alpha Phi Omega, Delta Sigma Pi and Phi Alpha Delta. SDSU was recognized in 2014 as one of 20 of the most Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender-friendly campuses in all of the U.S. The university attains this recognition through its welcome week LGBT reception, Safe Zone ally training, Big Gay BBQs, participating in Aids Walk San Diego and Pride San Diego, hosting an LGBT college fair, and holding a Lavender Graduation ceremony and several lecture series. The university is one of the few campuses in California that is home to the gay social fraternity, Delta Lambda Phi. Additionally, SDSU was the first university in California to offer a major in LGBT studies, while also offering a minor and graduate degree in the discipline. In 2014, SDSU opened a first-ever Pride Center at the former Student Organization Annex, with the mission to provide resources and help meet the needs and challenges of LGBT students. Students began publishing The White and Gold in 1902, which was a literary magazine and newspaper. In 1913, a new newspaper was established entitled Normal News Weekly. The school newspaper Paper Lantern (Normal News Weekly was renamed after the addition of the junior college) became The Aztec in September 1925. It was later expanded to its current name, The Daily Aztec in fall 1959. The school's annual yearbook was named Del Sudoeste (Spanish for "of the southwest") in the early 1920s. The Koala, a comedy newspaper that is widely known around the San Diego State area, is also distributed monthly on campus but is not directly connected to the school at the moment.

The Koala, the Satirical and Innovative collegiate newspaper in San Diego State The first major sport on campus was rowing, but it initially had no coaches or tournaments. Other sports that developed early in the campus's history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball. The school's football program had such a limited selection of players that faculty had to be used to fill the roster. When the college merged with the junior college in 1921, the college became a member of the Junior College Conference. After the school won most of the conference titles in a variety of sports, the league requested that college leave out of fairness to the smaller schools. For its football program, the team outscored its opponents 249 to 52 in ten games, resulting in the first sales of season tickets in 1923. From 1925 to 1926, the college played as an independent. It then joined the Southern California Conference in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled. The college remained with the conference until 1939, when it joined the California Collegiate Athletic Association. The basketball team reached and won multiple championships games during the 19301940s, including a conference title in 1931, 1934, 1937, and 1939. It reached the national championship in 1939 and 1940, losing in the final rounds. However, in 1941 the college returned and won the college's first national title. In track, the team won conference titles in 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939. The football team won conference titles in 1936 and 1937, and the baseball team won three conference titles and placed second three times between 1935 and 1941. In 1955, the Aztec Club was established and raised $20,000 a year by 1957. The club worked in increasing athletic scholarships, hiring better coaches, and developing the colleges intercollegiate athletic programs. In 1956, students approved through a vote of allowing a mandatory student activity fee, with a portion going to athletics. By the end of the decade the budget had doubled to $40,000. The campuss most successful sports program during the 1950s was cross-country, when the team won eight straight conference titles and AAU regional titles and placed high in national competitions. Basketball teams ranged from last in the conference to multiple conference, regional, and national appearances. The football program had its first undefeated team in 1951, but in the last part of the decade earned the worst records in the schools football program under the direction of head coach Paul Governali. Under Governali, the campuss football program suffered due to Governalis policy of not recruiting players. To improve the program, Love hired in 1961 Don Coryell, who led the program win three consecutive championships (196668), and 104 wins, 19 losses, and 2 ties by the time he left SDSU. Coryell was assisted by John Madden, Joe Gibbs, and Rod Dowhower, among others. In Coryells first year, attendance at home games averaged 8,000 people, but by 1966 it had doubled to 16,000. This later jumped to 26,00041,000 per game with the addition of the new San Diego Stadium. At some games, attendance was larger than at San Diego Chargers games. There were several undefeated seasons and many players broke records for most catches, touchdowns, and passing yards. In 1969, San Diego State College moved into NCAA Division I, leaving the California Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1972, Coyrell left to pursue coaching in the NFL. Basketball also did well, with the 196768 team being ranked the number one college-level team in the nation, although it did not win a national title. The Aztecs also won the 1960 CCAA baseball title and multiple national championships throughout the 1960s in track, cross country, and swimming. By 197071, the campus had 14 NCAA sports. The 1973 mens volleyball team won the NCAA national championship which was the first NCAA national title since moving to Division I status. SDSU competes in NCAA Division I FBS. Its primary conference is the Mountain West Conference; its women's rowing team competes in the American Athletic Conference, its women's water polo team participates in the Golden Coast Conference, and its men's soccer team is a single-sport member of the Pacific-12 Conference (Pac-12). The crew team's championship regatta is in the WIRA (Western International Rowing Association). The university colors are scarlet (red) and black, SDSU's athletic teams are called the "Aztecs", and its mascot is the Aztec Warrior, formerly referred to as "Monty Montezuma".

They advanced to National Championship final game in 2008 for ACHA Men's Division 3 and lost 73 to California University of Pennsylvania. = Aztec Racing is the San Diego State University's Society of Automotive Engineers chapter. Every year, engineering students of SDSU designs and constructs an open wheel, open cockpit race car to Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) specifications. Aztec Racing then competes against other universities' FSAE teams in an annual competition event, where the cars are raced against each other and judged on design. Attendance at FSAE competition is international, with several hundreds of schools competing each year. Students from other majors participate as well, frequently in the areas of management, promotion and other aspects of the project. = The new $12 million aquatic sports complex (known as the Aztec Aquaplex), includes an Olympic-size swimming pool, a separate recreational pool and beach, and a hydrotherapy spa. This facility is home for the swimming and diving teams, in addition to providing recreational use for all SDSU students and community members. In conjunction with the UCSD, the Associated Students organization of San Diego State University runs the Mission Bay Aquatic Center (MBAC) in Mission Bay, California, just a few miles west of the main campus. The MBAC provides for all manner of outdoor activities and sports for SDSU students, administration, and faculty. Initial clubs that were first started on campus including the Debating Club, the Associated Student Body, YWCA, and in 1906, An Alumni Association. The oldest club on campus was The Rowing Association. The San Diego State Marching Aztecs and Pep and Varsity Bands are often seen at many sporting events including Football, Basketball and even Volleyball. The San Diego State University (SDSU) campus is known as "Montezuma Mesa", as the university is situated on a mesa overlooking Mission Valley and is located at the intersection of Montezuma Road and College Avenue. Undie Run through campus that takes place during finals week each semester. On February 27, 1931, President Hardy permitted 500 students to paint rocks to form a 400-foot (120 m) white S on Cowles Mountain. The idea of "S Mountain" was created by the Council of Twelve and initially supported by Hardy. The giant S was lit at night for the opening football game of a season (performed by the freshman to build school spirit) along with pep rallies, and was repainted throughout its history. At the time, it was the largest collegiate symbol in the world. During World War II, the S was camouflaged to prevent it becoming a reference point for enemy bombing aircraft. It was returned to its normal state in April 1944. In the 1970s students stopped painting it and brush obstructed the symbol. After a 1988 brush fire it was exposed, and students repainted it. In fall 1997, a group of 100 volunteers climbed Cowles Mountain after dusk to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the school by using flashlights to once again outline the S on the side of the mountain. In 1990, a high school prank defaced the S to read as "91" in honor of their graduating class. The initial colors of the school were white and gold. When the junior college was added to the campus in 1921, its colors of blue and gold were merged, resulting in a blue, gold, and white color scheme. New colors were later chosen as gold and purple, until being replaced by scarlet and black on January 28, 1928. The school's prior nicknames for its mascot included "Normalites", "Professors", and "Wampus Cats". However, after a 1924 committee met to address the issue, the name "Aztecs" was decided on. In 2003, the Aztec Warrior was approved by a student and alumni vote to become the official university mascot after the school's prior mascot, Monty Montezuma, was discontinued. Film and television The two main characters from the 2004 Academy Award-winning comedy/drama film Sideways were roommates during their college days at SDSU. The SDSU campus is the setting of Hearst College, the fictional university in The CW television network show Veronica Mars. The exterior shots of Rancho Carne High School in the movie Bring it On were mainly filmed at San Diego State University Portions of The Real World: San Diego were filmed around the SDSU campus SDSU was ranked as one of the most dangerous college campuses in the U.S. in 2012 by Business Insider. It placed San Diego State as the sixth most dangerous campus (of those having over 10,000 students and according to data from 2008 to 2011), due to 27 violent crimes and 575 property crimes per year. 1996 campus shooting The San Diego State University shooting occurred on August 15, 1996. A 36-year-old graduate engineering student, while apparently defending his thesis, shot and killed his three professors, Constantinos Lyrintzis, Cheng Liang, and D. Preston Lowrey III, at San Diego State University. The shooter, who was suffering from certain mental problems, was convicted on July 19, 1997, and was sentenced to life in prison. As a memorial, tables with a plaque with information about each victim have been placed adjacent to the College of Engineering building. 2008 student drug arrests On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration announced the arrest of 96 individuals, of whom 33 were San Diego State University students, on a variety of drug charges in a narcotics sting operation dubbed Operation Sudden Fall. It was originally reported that 75 of the arrested were students, but the inflated number included students who had been arrested months earlier, in some cases for simple possession. The bust, which was the largest in the history of San Diego County, drew a mixed reaction from the community. Sexual Assault In 2015, SDSU began operation "It's on Us" to combat the sexual assault crisis the university was experiencing. In the fall 2014 semester alone, there were 14 sexual assaults reported on or around the SDSU college area. Furthermore, SDSU was noted in early 2015 for falsely accusing a foreign-exchange student of sexual assault and allegedly not affording the student due-process. The student has since sued the university. San Diego State University has over 260,000 alumni worldwide. The university is one of the top producers of U.S. Student Fulbright Scholars in the nation.
