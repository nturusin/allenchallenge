The British Rail Class 350 Desiro is a class of electrical multiple unit built by Siemens AG in 200405, 200809 and 201314. Thirty of these units, designated Class 350/1, were built for use by Central Trains and Silverlink on regional express services and services on the southern section of the West Coast Main Line. A further 37 Class 350/2 were ordered by London Midland in late 2007. All 37 units were delivered and in service by July 2009. A further 20 units are currently on order, which will be split equally between London Midland and First TransPennine Express. The London Midland units will be designated under the Class 350/3 subfleet, and the First TransPennine Express units designated 350/4. The Siemens Desiro UK family also includes units of Classes 185, 360, 380, 444 and 450. The Class 350/1 units were originally part of an order for thirty-two 5-car Class 450 units for South West Trains. However, they were never built as such. Of the 160 carriages ordered, 40 were diverted as an additional ten 4-car Class 450 units, and the remaining 120 were modified as thirty 4-car Class 350/1 units. The top speed of the fleet was originally 100 mph (160 km/h), but all 350/1s were modified to allow 110 mph (180 km/h) running from December 2012, in order to make better use of paths on the busy West Coast Main Line. A second batch of Class 350/2 units, intended to replace the Class 321 units, was delivered in late 2008 and during 2009. The first of the Class 350/2 was launched on 8 October 2008 and carried invited guests around the Wildenrath Test Track. The last of the Class 350/2 fleet (350267) was officially delivered to London Midland on 30 July 2009. Class 350/2 differ from the Class 350/1 units in two key aspects: they have 3+2 seating in standard class (because they work short-hop commuter services, the Class 350/1 are 2+2 throughout, work longer distance services) and lack the dual-voltage capability of the 350/1. Class 350 trains are nearly identical to those of Class 450. The latter class is only fitted with traction equipment for Southern Region 750 V DC third rail, whilst the Class 350/1 units can operate from both 25 kV AC OLE, as is done in regular service, or alternatively third rail. This dual-voltage capability came in useful when several units were leased to Southern in 2008-09 in order to cover for similarly equipped Class 377/2 units temporarily sub-leased to First Capital Connect, themselves to cover for delays in the construction of the 377/5 fleet. All 350 units built since are not equipped for third-rail use but, like most modern British EMUs, can be retrofitted if necessary. Every set of doors has its own set of guard-operated door controls behind a lockable panel. The cabs have three radio systems - Cab Secure Radio (CSR), National Radio Network (NRN) and the newest system, GSM-R. CCTV and Flip Dot destination screens are fitted throughout the train. The only visual difference externally between a 350/1 and 350/2 is the carriage end connector doors on a 350/2 are 1/2 yellow and black. This visual difference has been kept for the 350/3 and 350/4 units, ordered by London Midland and First TransPennine Express respectively. The first Class 350s entered service in June 2005 with Central Trains. These operated on services between Birmingham and Northampton via Coventry, and all Birmingham - Liverpool services, replacing Class 170 units. Most recently Desiros have taken over some peak services between Birmingham and Walsall. Silverlink began operating in July 2005 between London Euston - Milton Keynes Central and Northampton. The Class 350/1 were originally painted in an overall grey livery with blue doors and blue window surrounds with a mandatory yellow front-end warning panel required by safety rules. The original dual use of the units on Silverlink and Central Trains services mandated a non-operator specific livery. The Central Trains and Silverlink franchises expired in 2007. At this point, the entire fleet transferred to the new West Midlands franchisee, London Midland. As part of the agreement, London Midland embarked on the acquisition of a significant number of new trains, the largest order of which was for 37 additional Class 350s. The first 10 350/2 units entered service in December 2008. In addition to the existing operations, these units took over the new Crewe - London Euston service running via Stoke-on-Trent and stopping at most of the Trent Valley Line stations. The London Midland fleet is based at a new purpose-built depot at Northampton, which opened in June 2006 and can also service Class 321 and other Desiro units if required. It is located at Kings Heath, near Kingsthorpe. The First TransPennine Express units will be based at TPE's existing Ardwick depot with the government providing funding for the required electrification. Four 350/1s were subleased to Southern from 2008 to 2009, to provide cover for Class 377 units subleased to First Capital Connect. After newer Class 377 "Electrostar" trains were built, these units were returned to London Midland. Ten additional four-car units have been built for the London Midland franchise, to provide additional capacity entering service from October 2014. Ten additional four-car units were introduced in 2013 for the First TransPennine Express to coincide with the completion of the electrification of the eastern section of the Manchester to Liverpool via Newton-le-Willows line. These units are used on services between Manchester and Edinburgh / Glasgow, while the displaced Class 185s have remained with TransPennine to enhance capacity on other routes. The new trains have a revised specification allowing 110 mph (177 km/h) running with an intercity-style interior described as similar to the existing 185s. The first TPE Class 350/4 services ran on 30 December 2013 between Manchester Piccadilly and Glasgow Central. The trains operate from Manchester Airport and Preston to Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley. By May 2014, all ten EMUs were to have been delivered to TransPennine Express allowing most services on the Manchester to Scotland route to be operated using EMUs. However some services on Fridays and at weekends will remain diagrammed for the existing Class 185 DMUs as services run in six or eight car formations on Fridays and at weekends and the ten 350/4s do not cover all diagrams. Most units are owned by Angel Trains, although units Class 350/2 are owned by Porterbrook. Named units are as follows: 350110 - Project 110 350232 - Chad Varah On 11 April 2011 a fire broke out in a toilet cubicle on unit 350232, following an explosion, while working the 16:25 from Northampton to London Euston as it approached Leighton Buzzard, resulting in the death of the female occupant of the toilet, Rachel James. Her death turned out to be suicide, as she carried a can of petrol into the toilet and locked the door. All other passengers and the train crew escaped unharmed. Damage to the train was not serious and it was repaired at Wolverton.
