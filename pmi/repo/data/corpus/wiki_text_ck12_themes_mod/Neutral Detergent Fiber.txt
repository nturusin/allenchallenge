Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) is the most common measure of fiber used for animal feed analysis, but it does not represent a unique class of chemical compounds. NDF measures most of the structural components in plant cells (i.e. lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose), but not pectin. The process involves a neutral detergent that dissolves plant pectins, proteins, sugars and lipids. Thus leaving the fibreous parts behind such as cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. These parts are not easily digestable, and are often not desired within a feedstuff. Recent nutritional requirement tables of ruminants report limits for NDF intake. The level of NDF in the animal ration influences the intake of dry matter and the time of rumination, although the concentration of NDF in feeds is negatively correlated with energy concentration.
