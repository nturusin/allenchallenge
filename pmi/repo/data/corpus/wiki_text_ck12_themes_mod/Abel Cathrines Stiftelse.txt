Abel Cathrines Stiftelse is a listed building in Abel Cathrines Gade between Vesterbrogade and Istedgade in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen, Denmark. It was built to provide housing for indigent women by a charity established in 1675 by Abel Cathrine von der Wisch, Queen Sophie Amalie's lady-in-waiting, replacing an earlier building in the city centre. Completed in 1886, it was designed by Hermann Baage Storck and is an early example of the National Romantic style.. Presumably the illegitimate daughter of Wolf von der Wisch, a nobleman, Abel Cathrine von der Wisch was born in Schleswig or Holstein in either 1626 or 1627. She was the wife of Hans Hansen Oster who was a bookkeeper (proviantskriver) at Proviantgrden on Slotsholmen in Copenhagen as well as inspector of Queen Sofie Amalies's estates on Lolland and Falster. In 1675, she funded the construction of a row of seven houses with pauper accommodation in Dronningens Tvrggade, founding Abel Cathrines Stiftelse on 27 December 1875, just a few days before her death. The almshouses in Dronningens Tvrgade were demolished in 1885 and replaced by a new building with residences for indigent women in the emerging Vesterbro district. The building was designed by Hermann Baage Storck and inaugurated on 31 October 1886. The building contained 31 residences which generally housed two women each. The north wing of the building contained a chapel. The charity was dissolved in 1949 and the building was ceded to Copenhagen Municipality and used as a refuge for homeless people. The chapel was dismantled in 1969. Some of its inventory was handed over to the Copenhagen City Museum. The charity's archives are kept in Copenhagen City Archives at Copenhagen City Hall. On 31 October 1981, the rundown building was squatted. The squatters left the building on 14 February 1982 and it was subsequently refurbished. Abel Cathrines Stiftelse is a symmetrical, four-winged building constructed in red brick. It was listed in 1980. In the vestibule inside the main entrance are two plaques: one of them reads :"Abel Cathrine oprettede som enke efter proviantskriver Hans Hansen ved testamente af 27. December 1675 denne stiftelse til bolig for fattige, syge og sengeliggende mennesker. Hun dde den 1. Januar 1676. Hendes navn bevares i taknemmelig hukommelse." and the other one reads "Abel Cathrines boder var i Dronningens Tvrgade fra 1676 -1885. Ved Magistratens omsorg og med kommunens hjlp flyttedes stiftelsen til denne bygning, der tages i brug den 31 oktober 1886: Guds nde vre over dette hus og dem som bor deri. ".
