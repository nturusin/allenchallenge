The Marshallese language (Marshallese: new orthography Kajin Maje or old orthography Kajin Majl, [kzin(e) mz]), also known as Ebon, is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken in the Marshall Islands by about 44,000 people, and the principal language of the country. There are two major dialects: Rlik (western) and Ratak (eastern). Marshallese, a Micronesian language, is a member of the Eastern Oceanic subgroup of the Austronesian languages. The closest linguistic relatives of Marshallese are the other Micronesian languages, including Chuukese, Gilbertese, Kosraean, Nauruan and Pohnpeian. Marshallese shows 33% lexican similarity with Pohnpeian. Within the Micronesian archipelago, Marshallese along with the rest of the Micronesian language group is not as closely related to the more ambiguously-classified Oceanic language Yapese in Yap State, or to the Polynesian outlier languages Kapingamarangi and Nukuoro in Pohnpei State, and are even less closely related to the SundaSulawesi languages of Palauan in Palau and Chamorro in the Mariana Islands. The Republic of the Marshall Islands contains 34 atolls that are split into two chains, the eastern Ratak Chain and the western Ralik Chain. These two chains have different dialects, which differ mainly lexically, and are mutually intelligible. The atoll of Ujelang in the west used to have "slightly less homogeneous speech", but it has been uninhabited since 1980. The Ratak and Ralik dialects differ phonetically in how they deal with stems that begin with double consonants. Ratak Marshallese inserts a vowel to separate the consonants, while Ralik adds a vowel before the consonants (and pronounced an unwritten consonant phoneme /j/ before the vowel). For example, the stem kkure 'play' becomes ukkure in Ralik Marshallese and kukure in Ratak Marshallese. Marshallese is the official language of the Marshall Islands and enjoys vigorous use. As of 1979, the language was spoken by 43,900 people in the Marshall Islands. Additional groups of speakers in other countries including Nauru and the United States bring the total number of Marshallese speakers to 49,550 Along with Pohnpeian and Chuukese, Marshallese stands out among Micronesian languages in having tens of thousands of speakers; most Micronesian languages have far fewer. A dictionary and Bible translation have been published in Marshallese. Marshallese has a large consonant inventory, where each consonant has some type of secondary articulation (palatalization, velarization, or rounding). The palatalized consonants are regarded as "light", and the velarized and rounded consonants are regarded as "heavy", with the rounded consonants being both velarized and labialized. (This is similar to "slender" and "broad" consonants in Goidelic languages, or "soft" and "hard" consonants in Russian.) The "light" consonants are considered the more relaxed articulations. The following are the consonant phonemes of Marshallese: Marshallese has no voicing contrast in consonants. However, stops may be allophonically partially voiced: [pb], [td], [k]. This occurs when they are between vowels and not geminated. Final consonants are often unreleased. The glides /j w/ are posited to vanish in many environments, coloring their surrounding vowel(s) in backness and roundedness. This is motivated by the limited surface distribution of these phonemes, as well as other evidence that backness and roundedness are not specified phonemically for Marshallese vowels. In fact, the consonant // never surfaces phonetically, but is used to explain the preceding phenomenon. (/j/ and /w/ may surface phonetically, but only in word-initial and word-final positions, and even then not consistently.) The consonant /t/ may be phonetically realized as [t], [ts], [s], [c], or [] (or any of their voiced variants [d], [dz], [z], [], or []), in free variation. Word-internally it usually assumes a voiced fricative articulation as [z] (or []), but not when geminated. /t/ is used to adapt foreign sibilants into Marshallese. Marshallese has no distinct /t/ phoneme. The dorsal consonants /k k / are usually velar, but with the tongue a little further back [k k ], making them somewhere between velar and uvular in articulation. All dorsal phonemes are "heavy" (velarized or rounded), and none are "light" (palatalized). As stated before, the palatal consonant articulations [c], [], [] and [] are treated as allophones of the palatalized coronal obstruent /t/, even though palatal consonants are physically dorsal. /n/ and /n/ are usually articulated as retroflex nasals [] and []. The consonants /r/, /r/ and /r/ are all coronal consonants and full trills. /r/ is similar to Spanish rr with a trill position on the alveolar ridge. But /r/ is a palatalized dental trill [r], articulated further forward behind the front teeth. The MarshalleseEnglish Dictionary (MED) and Willson (2003) describe the rhotic consonants as "retroflex", but are not clear how this relates to their dental or alveolar trill positions. (See retroflex trill.) The heavy lateral consonants /l/ and /l/ are dark Ls, articulated [] and [] respectively. The velarized consonants (and, by extension, the rounded consonants) may actually be velarized or pharyngealized. This is similar to the emphatic consonants in Arabic or Mizrahi Hebrew. Marshallese has a vertical vowel system of just four vowel phonemes, each with several allophones depending on the surrounding consonants. MED (1976), Choi (1992) and Willson (2003) notate some Marshallese vowels differently. Choi (1992) observes only three vowel phonemes, but theorizes there may be a historical process of reduction from four to three. This article uses the notation of the MED. Superficially, twelve Marshallese vowel allophones appear in minimal pairs, a common test for phonemicity. For example, [m] (m, 'breadfruit'), [m] (ma, 'but'), and [m] (mo, 'taboo') are separate Marshallese words. However, the uneven distribution of glide phonemes suggest that these underlyingly end with the glides (thus /maj/, /ma/, /maw/). When glides are taken into account, it emerges that there are only four vowel phonemes. When a vowel phoneme appears between consonants with different secondary articulations, the vowel surfaces as a smooth transition from one vowel allophone to the other. For example, jok 'shy', phonemically /tk/, is realized phonetically as [tk]. It follows that there are twenty-four possible diphthongs in Marshallese: Some syllables appear to contain long vowels, e.g. naaj 'future'. These syllables are thought to contain an underlying glide (/j/, // or /w/) which is not present phonetically. For instance, the underlying form of naaj is /naat/. Although the medial glide is not realized phonetically, it affects vowel quality; thus in a word like /naat/, the vowel smoothly transitions from [] to [] and then back to [], as [nt]. Syllables in Marshallese follow CV, CVC, and VC patterns. Marshallese words always underlyingly begin and end with consonants. Initial, final, and long vowels may be explained as the results of underlying glides which are not present on the phonetic level. Initial vowels are sometimes realized with an onglide [j] or [w], but not consistently: /jat/ [t ~ jt] 'weave' Only homorganic consonant sequences are allowed in Marshallese. This includes geminate varieties of each consonant. Non-homorganic clusters are separated by vowel epenthesis, even across word boundaries. Some homorganic clusters are also disallowed. Specifically: Obstruent-obstruent, nasal-nasal, liquid-liquid, nasal-obstruent, and nasal-liquid clusters undergo assimilation of the secondary articulation, except if the first consonant is a labialized coronal or a labialized dorsal, in which case the clusters undergo assimilation of the labialized articulation. Obstruent-liquid and liquid-obstruent clusters besides /lt/ and /lt/ undergo epenthesis. Liquid-nasal clusters undergo nasal assimilation Obstruent-nasal clusters undergo epenthesis (if coronal) or nasal assimilation (if non-coronal) This creates the following assimilations, with empty combinations representing epenthesis. The height of an epenthetic vowel is transitional between the two nearest vowels. Certain westernized Marshallese place names spell out these epenthetic vowels, including: Ebeye, from earlier Ebeje, from Epj Erikub, from dkup Kwajalein, from Kuwajleen Majuro, from Mjro Namorik, from Namdik Omelek, from Komle ("Komle, Komle") Rongelap, from Ronap Rongerik, from Rondik Ujelang, from Wjlan Uliga, from Wlka Utirik, from Utrk This article uses parentheses in IPA pronunciations to indicate epenthetic vowels in words, as they can be omitted altogether without affecting the meaning, such as in song or in enunciated syllable breaks. The short vowel phonemes /a / and the approximant phonemes /j w/ each occupy a roughly equal duration of time. Though they occupy time, the approximants are generally not articulated as glides, and Choi (1992) does not rule out a deeper level of representation. In particular, /V/ short vowels occupy one unit of time, and /VGV/ long vowels (where /G/ is an approximant phoneme) are three times as long. For phonemic clarity, this article uses the IPA symbols [ e i] for /j/, [ ] for // and [ o u] for /w/ where they occupy time as consonants at syllable boundaries. As a matter of prosody, each /C/ consonant and /V/ vowel phonemic sequence carries one mora in length, with the exception of /C/ in /CV/ sequences where the vowel carries one mora for both phonemes. All morae are thus measured in /CV/ or shut /C/ sequences: /CVC/ is two morae: /CV-C/. It is also the shortest possible length of Marshallese word. /CVCVC/ is three morae: /CV-CV-C/. Since approximants are also consonants, long vowel sequences of /CVGVC/ are also three morae. /CVCCVC/ is four morae: /CV-C-CV-C/. Prefixes like ri- are /CV-/ sequences occupying only one mora, but are attached to words rather than standing as words on their own. Suffixes like -in are /-VC/ sequences. Though the syllable itself occupies two morae, it only adds one mora to the word because the vowel attaches itself to the last consonant phoneme in the word, changing /-C/ to /-CV-C/. This makes Marshallese a mora-rhythmed language in a fashion similar to Finnish, Gilbertese, Hawaiian or Japanese. The Marshallese consonants showing splits were conditioned by the surrounding Proto-Micronesian vowels. Proto-Micronesian *k * *r become rounded next to *o, or next to *u except in bisyllables whose other vowel is unrounded. The default outcomes of *l and *n are palatalized; they become velarized or rounded before *a, or sometimes *o, if there is no high vowel in an adjacent syllable, and in this event roundedness is determined by the same rule as above. Marshallese is written in the Latin alphabet. There are two competing orthographies. The "old" orthography was introduced by missionaries. This system is not highly consistent or faithful in representing the sounds of Marshallese, but until recently had no competing orthography. It is currently widely used, including in newspapers and signs. The "new" orthography is gaining popularity, especially in schools and among young adults and children. The "new" orthography represents the sounds of the Marshallese language more faithfully, and it is the system used in the MarshalleseEnglish dictionary by Abo et al., currently the only complete published Marshallese dictionary. Here is the current alphabet, as promoted by the Republic of the Marshall Islands. It consists of 24 letters. Marshallese spelling is based on pronunciation rather than a phonemic analysis. Therefore, backness is marked in vowels despite the fact that this is allophonic, and many instances of the glides /j/ // /w/ which have been proposed on the phonemic level are unwritten, because they do not surface as consonants phonetically. In particular, the glide //, which never surfaces as a consonant phonetically, is always unwritten (though bimorphemic words like Bok-ak, where the phoneme // is present after a morpheme juncture, may alternatively be written with a doubled vowel, as in Bokaak [pk] "Bokak"). The letter w is generally only used in two situations: To mark a labialized consonant (one of kw w w nw rw) or approximant phoneme (w) before a vowel that will be spelt one of a e i (before an unrounded consonant phoneme). To mark a velarized bilabial consonant (either bw or mw) before a vowel that will be spelt one of e i (before a palalatalized consonant phoneme). w is never written out word-finally or before another consonant. Kuwajleen / Kuajleen [kuz()ln] "Kwajalein". The palatal approximant phoneme /j/ may also be written out, but only either as e before one of a o o, or as i before one of either u . The approximant is never written before any of e i. For historical reasons, certain words like iokwe may be written as yokwe with a y that does not otherwise exist in the Marshallese alphabet. One source of orthographic variation is in the representation of vowels. Pure monophthongs are written consistently based on vowel quality. However, diphthongs may often be written with either one of the two vowel sounds they contain: wtm / otem [oodem] "all; every". Modern orthography has a bias in certain spelling choices where both possibilities are equally clear between two non-approximant consonants. a is preferred over . ap [p] "big", not *p i is preferred over . dik [rik] "small", not *dk Historically, both and e have been common and sometimes interchangeable. This is still true today with some words. In the new orthography, is generally preferred over e in most such situations. aeln [ele] "atoll; island; land", not *aelen Epatn [bdn] "Ebadon", not *Epaten Krijmj [kriz(i)met] "Christmas", not *Krijmej N [n] "Nell", not *Ne However, after one of d j m p and before one of unrounded b k m n r t, the spelling e is preferred over . pinje [pinz] "pencil", not *pinj For the name of the Marshall Islands, the new orthography prefers e, but the spelling with is still found. Maje or Maj [mz], "Marshall Islands" In a syllable where the first consonant is labialized and the second consonant is palatalized, it is common to see the vowel between them written as one of a , usually associated with a neighboring velarized consonant. For instance: Okwj [t] "August". Wjlan [uuiz(e)l] "Ujelang". The exception to this variation is long vowels and long diphthongs made up of two mora units, which are written with the vowel quality closer to the phonetic nucleus of the long syllable: jouj [teouit] "kindness". naaj [nt] "will be". tkji [t()zii] "taxicab". If the syllable is phonetically open, the vowel written is usually the second vowel in the diphthong. For example, the word bwe [p] is usually not written any other way. But there can still be exceptions, such as aeln (/ajl/ [ele] "land; country; island; atoll"), which is preferred over *eln because the a spelling emphasizes that the first (unwritten) approximant consonant phoneme is dorsal rather than palatal. The spelling of grammatical affixes, such as ri- (/r-/) and -in (/-n/) is less variable, despite the fact that their vowels become diphthongs with second member dependent on the preceding/following consonant.. For instance, the prefix ri- may be pronounced as any of [ri r ru] depending on the stem, e.g. the term Ri-Maje ("Marshallese people") is actually pronounced [r-mz], as if it were Rmaje. In the most polished printed text, the letters M m O o always appear with unaltered cedillas directly beneath, and the letters N n always appear with unaltered macrons directly above. Regardless, these diacritics are often replaced by ad hoc spellings using more common or more easily displayable characters. In particular, the Marshallese-English Online Dictionary (but not the print version), or MOD, uses the following characters: As of 2013, there are no dedicated precomposed characters in Unicode for the letters M m N n O ofor now, they can only be displayed as plain Latin letters with combining diacritics, and even many Unicode fonts will not display these combinations properly and neatly. And though do exist as precomposed characters in Unicode, these letters also do not display properly as Marshallese letters in most Unicode fontsUnicode defines the letters as having a cedilla, but fonts usually display them with a comma below because of rendering expectations of the Latvian alphabet. Both systems already require fonts that display Basic Latin (with A a B b D d E e I i J j K k L l M m N n O o P p R r T t U u W w) and Latin Extended-A (with ). The standard orthography also requires Spacing Modifier Letters for the combining diacritics. The MOD's alternative letters have the advantage of being neatly displayable as all-precomposed characters in any Unicode fonts that support Basic Latin, Latin Extended-A along with Latin-1 Supplement (with ) and Latin Extended Additional (with ). If a font comfortably displays both the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration and the Vietnamese alphabet, it can also display MOD Marshallese. This chart highlights the display issues in common web fonts and common free Unicode fonts that are known to support standard or MOD Marshallese lettering. Distinct typefaces only appear if your operating environment supports them. Some fonts have combining diacritic alignment issues, and the vast majority of the fonts have the Latvian diacritic issue. The old orthography was still very similar to the new orthography, but made fewer phonological distinctions in spelling than the new orthography does. The new orthography attempts phonological consistency while adhering to most of the spelling patterns of the old orthography, especially in regard to vowels and w. This has made the new orthography relatively easy for old orthography users to learn. The phonology of Marshallese was documented by Bender (1969) with written examples using the old orthography. Some differences between the new and old orthographies: The new orthography uses the cedillaed letters m o. The old orthography did not use cedillas, and ambiguously wrote these l m n o. The new orthography uses p for "light" /p/ and b for "heavy" /p/. The old orthography used b for both. Compare old binjel vs. new pinje [pinz], 'pencil'. The new orthography consistently uses d for "light" /r/ in all positions. The old orthography often wrote this dr before vowels, and r after vowels. Compare old Amerka vs. new Amedka [mr()], 'United States'. Compare old indreo or indrio vs. new indeeo [iinree], 'forever'. Except in certain affixes like -an where the spelling of the vowels may be fixed, the new orthography spells the vowel monophthong allophone [] as in all positions. The old orthography had but it was relatively less common, and [] was sometimes written e instead. Compare old Ebeje vs. new Epj [b()z], 'Ebeye'. Except in certain affixes like ri- where the spelling of the vowels may be fixed, the new orthography spells the vowel monophthong allophone [] as in all positions. The old orthography spelt [] as i between consonants. Compare old Kirijmj vs. new Krijmj [kriz(i)met], 'Christmas'. The new orthography only uses the letters e o for allophones of the vowel phoneme //. In the old orthography, some words used e o , but other words used i u () instead. Compare old ailin vs. new aeln [ele], 'land'. The new orthography uses the letter o for the vowel monophthong allophone [] along with many of its related diphthong allophones. The old orthography spelt [] as a between consonants, but o at the ends of words. Compare old iakwe vs. new iokwe [i], 'hello; good bye; love'. Compare old mo vs. new mo [m], 'taboo'. The new orthography tries to consistently write long vowels and geminated consonants with double letters. The old orthography habitually wrote these as single letters. Compare old ekatak vs. new ekkatak [kdk], 'study'. Compare old jab vs. new jaab [tp], 'no'. The word iokwe [i] ('hello; goodbye; love') and the phrase iokwe eok [i eeok] ('hello [to you]') are a special case. The new orthography's rules favor the spelling iokwe eok, while the old orthography's rules favored the spelling iakwe iuk. But yokwe yuk has been historically more entrenched in both orthographies, though the letter y does not exist in the normal spelling rules of either orthography. This spelling has multilingual significance as well; yokwe (yuk) /jkwe (jk)/ is also the established spelling for the greeting when used in Marshallese-influenced English and by anglophones in the Marshall Islands. Nouns are not marked as nouns, and do not inflect for number, gender, or case. Nouns are often verbalized and verbs nominalized without any overt morphological marker: Je-n al al in plle. 1pl.in.agr-should sing.trans song of be.covered(=American) 'We should sing American songs.' (Willson 2008) Marshallese has determiners and demonstratives which follow the noun they modify. These are marked for number, and in the plural also encode a human/nonhuman distinction. For example, in the singular pinje eo 'the pencil' and addik eo 'the boy' take the same determiner, but in the plural pinje ko 'the pencils' and addik ko have different determiners. Indefinites are an exception; in the singular they are expressed with the word juon 'one' before the noun (e.g. juon al 'a song'), and there is no plural indefinite determiner. The Marshallese demonstrative system has five levels: near the speaker (sg. e / pl. human r / pl. nonhuman k), near the speaker and listener (in / rein / kein), near the listener (e / rae / kae), away from both speaker and listener (e / ra / ka), and distant but visible (uweo / roro / koko). Marshallese possesses two sets of 1st and 2nd person singular pronouns, known as "absolutive" or "emphatic" pronouns and as "objective" pronouns. Marshallese 1st person plurals mark for clusivity. Third person objective pronouns may only be used for humans; nonhumans instead take a null pronoun: E-ar dent er. 3s.agr-T(past) slap.trans 3pl.obj 'He slapped them (human).' (Willson 2008) E-ar dent-i. 3s.agr-T(past) slap.trans-obj 'He slapped them (nonhuman).' (Willson 2008) The emphatic pronouns serve as subjects of equational sentences, as complements of prepositions, in order to emphasize objects, in coordination structures, and with topicalized or focused subjects. It is common in Oceanic languages for a special type of pronoun to be used in equational sentences and for topicalization or focus. Na rikaki. 1s.emph teacher 'I am a teacher.' (Willson 2008) Na i-j yokwe ajiri ro nej-. 1s.emph 1s.agr.T(pres) love child the.pl.h cher.poss-1s.gen 'Me, I love my children.' (Willson 2008) Marshallese, similarly to many Micronesian languages, divides sentences into two types: predicational sentences and equational sentences. Predicational sentences have SVO word order and a main verb: E-j kajanjan kita. 3rdS-PRES play guitar. 'He plays guitar.' (Willson 2002) In equational sentences, both the subject and predicate are noun phrases: Nuknuk eo e-aibujuij. Dress DET 3rdS-beautiful. 'The dress is beautiful.' (Willson 2002) This includes the cardinal numbers one through ten in the Rlik dialect.
