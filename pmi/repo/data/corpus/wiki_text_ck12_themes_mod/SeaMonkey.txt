SeaMonkey is a free and open-source Internet suite. It is the continuation of the former Mozilla Application Suite, based on the same source code, which itself grew out of Netscape Communicator and formed the base of Netscape 6 and Netscape 7. SeaMonkey was created in 2005 as a continuation of the Mozilla Application Suite, after the Mozilla Foundation decided to focus on standalone projects such as Firefox and Thunderbird. The development of SeaMonkey is community-driven, in contrast to the Mozilla Application Suite, which until its last released version (1.7.13) was governed by the Mozilla Foundation. The new project-leading group is called the SeaMonkey Council. Compared to Firefox, the SeaMonkey web browser keeps the far more traditional-looking interface of Netscape and the Mozilla Suite. Many Firefox and Thunderbird add-ons can be converted to make them compatible with SeaMonkey if they aren't already. SeaMonkey consists of a web browser, which is a descendant of the Netscape family, an e-mail and news client program (SeaMonkey Mail & Newsgroups, which shares code with Mozilla Thunderbird), an HTML editor (SeaMonkey Composer) and an IRC client (ChatZilla). The software suite supports skins. It comes with two skins in the default installation, Modern and Classic. SeaMonkey Mail is a traditional e-mail client that includes support for multiple accounts, junk mail detection, message filters, HTML message support, and address books, among other features. It shares code with Mozilla Thunderbird; both Thunderbird and SeaMonkey are built from Mozilla's comm-central source tree. SeaMonkey Composer is a WYSIWYG HTML editor. Its main user interface features four tabs: Normal (WYSIWYG), HTML tags, HTML code, and browser preview. The generated code is HTML 4.01 Transitional. SeaMonkey Composer is no longer actively maintained, but the underlying editor code is shared with the Mail component. The SeaMonkey project releases official builds for Linux, OS X, and Windows. It also releases unofficial x86-64 builds for Linux. To avoid confusing organizations that still want to use the original Mozilla Suite, the new product needed a new name. After initial speculation by members of the community, a July 2, 2005 announcement confirmed that SeaMonkey would officially become the name of the Internet suite superseding the Mozilla Suite. "Seamonkey" (with a lowercase "m") had been used by Netscape and the Mozilla Foundation as a code name for the never-released "Netscape Communicator 5" and later the Mozilla Suite itself. Originally, the name derived from the need for a nicer word to replace ButtMonkey, which had won a contest to decide the codename, and was chosen with reference to brine shrimp. The SeaMonkey Council has now trademarked the name with help from the Mozilla Foundation. The project uses a separate numbering scheme, with the first release being called SeaMonkey 1.0. Despite having a different name and version number, SeaMonkey 1.0 is based on the same code as Mozilla Suite 1.8. For trademark and copyright reasons, Debian rebranded SeaMonkey and distributed it as Iceape until 2013. On March 10, 2005, the Mozilla Foundation announced that it would not release any official versions of Mozilla Application Suite beyond 1.7.x, since it had now focused on the standalone applications Firefox and Thunderbird. However, the Foundation emphasized that it would still provide infrastructure for community members who wished to continue development. In effect, this meant that the suite would still continue to be developed, but now by the SeaMonkey Council instead of the Mozilla Foundation. The first release of SeaMonkey happened on September 15, 2005. SeaMonkey 1 was released on January 30, 2006. Core Mozilla project source code was licensed under a disjunctive tri-license (before changing to MPL 2.0) that gave the choice of one of the three following sets of licensing terms: Mozilla Public License, version 1.1 or later, GNU General Public License, version 2.0 or later, GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later. The SeaMonkey Council, which is the team responsible for project and release management, currently consists of Philip Chee, Karsten Dsterloh, Jens Hatlak, Robert Kaiser, Ian Neal, Neil Rashbrook and Justin Wood. Parts of this table are based on the SeaMonkey release notes, the roadmap and the meeting notes.
