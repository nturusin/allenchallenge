The Johnson distribution is a four-parameter family of probability distributions first investigated by N. L. Johnson in 1949. Johnson proposed it as a transformation of the normal distribution: Where Let U be a random variable that is uniformly distributed on the unit interval [0, 1]. Johnson random variables can be generated from U as follows: where is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.
