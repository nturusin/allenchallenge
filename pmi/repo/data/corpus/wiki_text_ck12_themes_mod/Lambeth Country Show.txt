The Lambeth Country Show a large, free community gathering that takes place annually in Brockwell Park in Lambeth, generally on the third weekend of July. There are many events at the show, which is funded by Lambeth Council. These include horse riding displays, displays of birds of prey and owls, a variety of animals from the local Vauxhall City Farm, a fun fair, musical performances from quite well known bands such as Aswad, a crafts display and more. Many community groups have a presence at the show and there are a wide variety of foods and drinks available, including the infamous Chucklehead Cider which has been responsible for many a Monday morning hangover in south London. Chief among the attractions is the novel "vegetable animal" competition which features as part of the Flower Show. Locals compete to create strange and wonderful creatures out of vegetables, which has in the past included an owl made from a pineapple, dinosaurs made from potatoes, and a figurine of Nigel Farage being slapped by a wet fish. Other attractions include sheep shearing, a scarecrow competition and jousting. About 180,000 people attend the show and come from all sectors of the diverse inner-london community, making it one of the largest free community festivals in Europe. The 2010 show was the 36th. The 2012 Lambeth Country Show took place later than usual, on 15 and 16 September, to avoid clashing with the London Olympics. The 2014 Country Show - the 40th year of the event - takes place on Saturday 19 and Sunday 20 July.
