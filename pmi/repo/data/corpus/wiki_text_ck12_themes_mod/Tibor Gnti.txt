Tibor Gnti (10 September 1933 15 April 2009) was a Hungarian theoretical biologist and biochemist, who is best known for the chemoton, a model for defining the minimal nature of life. He taught industrial biochemistry at Etvs University, and theoretical biology at University of Gdll, Jzsef Attila University and Etvs University. Tibor Gnti worked as laboratory assistant at the Bacteriological Laboratory, Factory of Canned Food at Dunakeszi from 1951-1952. He then moved to Photochemical Research Institute of Vc in 1953-1954. From 1958 to 1965 he was the Head of Yeast Laboratory, Yeast Factory, Budapest. In the meantime he completed a Diploma in Chemical Engineering from the Technical University of Budapest in 1958, and a Dr.techn. (PhD) in 1962. Between 1965 and 1974 he was the Head of Biochemical Department at the REANAL Factory of Laboratory Chemicals in Budapest. He was honoured a doctorate in biological science by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1980. Gnti joined 1968-1972 Etvs University as a guest lecturer of industrial biochemistry in 1968. In 1974 he became a guest lecturer of the theoretical biology at the University of Gdll. Between 1975 and 1979 he taught theoretical biology at Jzsef Attila University, Szeged. He became guest professor of the theoretical biology at Etvs University in 1978 up to 1999. Gnti made himself a forefront scientist in 1971 by introducing a theory called chemoton. According to the chemoton model, life should basically but necessarily have an autocatalytic subsystem consisting of metabolism and a replication process, and a membrane enclosing these functions. It may be the most significant contribution to theoretical biology for understanding the chemical basis and origin of life as it provides a philosophy of evolutionary units. 1982 Herman Otto prize 1986 MTESz prize 1989 Pro Natura medal Forradalom az let kutatsban (1966), Gondolat, Budapest Az let princpiuma (1971), Gondolat, Budapest A chemotonelmlet alapjai (1974), Fizikai Szemle.
