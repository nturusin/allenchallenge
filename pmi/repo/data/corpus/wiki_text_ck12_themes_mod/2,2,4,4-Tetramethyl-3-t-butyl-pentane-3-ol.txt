2,2,4,4-Tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane-3-ol is an organic compound with formula C13H28O, or ((H3C-)3C-)3COH. It is an alcohol that can be viewed as a tridecane isomer (2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane) where the central hydrogen has been replaced by a hydroxyl group -OH. The bulky tert-butyl groups (H3C-)3C- groups attached to the central carbon prevent the hydroxyl group from forming the hydrogen bonds that are characteristic of most alcohols. Indeed, as of 2003 this was the only known organic compound with that property, which made it interesting for research in spectroscopy.
