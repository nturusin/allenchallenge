The East Madagascar Current is an oceanic flow feature near Madagascar. It flows southward from 20S on the east side of Madagascar to the southern limit at Cape Saint Marie and subsequently feeds the Agulhas Current. Its flow is complicated by large cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. It creates a high pressure area and affects Indian Monsoon.
