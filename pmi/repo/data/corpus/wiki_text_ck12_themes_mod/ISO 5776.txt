ISO 5776, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is an international standard that specifies symbols for proofreading such as of manuscripts, typescripts and printer's proofs. The total number of symbols specified is 16, each in English, French and Russian. The standard is partially derived from the British Standard BS-5261, but is closer to German standards DIN 16511 and 16549-1. All of these standards date from the time before desktop publishing.
