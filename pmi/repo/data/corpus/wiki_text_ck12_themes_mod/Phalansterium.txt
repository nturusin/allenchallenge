Phalansterium is a genus of single-celled organisms comprising several species. Phalansterium produces tetraspores. Phalansterium is hard to classify; it has a distinctive ultrastructure of its pericentriolar material. Molecular evidence places it in the Amoebozoa. It has been suggested that it is similar to the ancestral eukaryote.
