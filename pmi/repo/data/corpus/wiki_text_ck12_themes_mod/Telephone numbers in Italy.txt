Since 1998, telephone numbers in Italy follow a closed telephone numbering plan, with landline numbers starting with 0, mobile numbers starting with 3, and special services assigned other initial digits. Landline numbers (area code+exchange+number) are generally 9 or 10 digits long, although they can be as few as 6 or as many as 11 digits. Mobile numbers are always 10 digits long, with the only exception of very old TIM numbers, which are 9 digits long (though those are now extremely rare). Mobile phone number in Italy: without a zero, started with a 3. Mobile phone numbers are generally 10 digits long (3 digits for the prefix + 7 digits for the subscriber number). However, some rare 9 digits long (3+6) phone numbers are still in use, and so are new numbers with 11 digits (3+8). 3xx xxxxxxx (within Italy and San Marino) +39 3xx xxxxxxx (from the rest of the world) +393289146236 In early 1998, a new numbering plan was proposed which on 19 June 1998 would remove the earlier trunk code 0 from all telephone numbers and add 0 as the first digit of landline numbers only. Subsequently, the leading 0 was to be replaced by "4" starting from 29 December 2000, making all landline numbers begin with a "4"; all mobile phone numbers, with a "3"; and other telephone services, with the remaining digits. The first part of the plan was carried out whilst the second part was postponed indefinitely, leaving 0 as the first digit of landline numbers (unlike in the closed numbering plans of many other countries where 0 is a trunk code). A landline number in Rome (area code 06) is thus called in the following manner: xxxxxxxx (from within Romebefore 1999) 06 xxxxxxxx (from within Romeafter 1999) 06 xxxxxxxx (from outside Romeboth before and after 1999) +39 6 xxxxxxxx (from abroadbefore 1999) +39 06 xxxxxxxx (from abroadafter 1999) A Vodafone Italy mobile number is called as follows: 0347 xxxxxxx (from within Italybefore 1999) 347 xxxxxxx (from within Italyafter 1999) +39 347 xxxxxxx (from abroadboth before and after 1999) Until 1996, San Marino was part of the Italian numbering plan, using the Italian area code 0549 but in that year it adopted its own country code 378. However, instead of using international dialing codes, dialing arrangements between San Marino and Italy continued as before. In 1998, San Marino incorporated the 0549 area code into its subscribers' numbers, following the Italian format: 0549 xxxxxx (San Marino from Italy) +39 0549 xxxxxx (San Marino from the rest of the world via Italy) +378 0549 xxxxxx (San Marino from the rest of the world directly) Similarly, Vatican City is assigned country code 379. However, Vatican City is still reached via the Italian numbering plan. Telephone numbers in the Vatican City are similar to telephone numbers in Rome, with "698" following the "06" for Rome. 06 698x xxxx (Vatican City from Italy) +39 06 698x xxxx (Vatican City from the rest of the world via Italy) +379 06 698x xxxx (Vatican City from the rest of the world directly; not yet implemented as of 2015) 00- International access code 00800- International toll-free numbers 0878- Mass calls phone number (polls, television programs, etc. ), max. 0.66 + 0.23/min 0- Landline numbers 1- Service and emergency numbers 112 Gendarmerie (Carabinieri) 113 Police (Polizia di Stato) 115 Fire brigade (Vigili del Fuoco) 116 Road help (ACI) 117 Italian Customs/Financial/Border Police Guardia di Finanza 118 Ambulance (Italian Red Cross included) 12xx Premium rate services 144- Premium rate services, max. 0.07 + 1.31/min 15xx Other emergency and information services 1515 Forest and environmental emergency (Corpo Forestale dello Stato) 1518 Road information service (CCISS) 1530 Coastguard (Corps of the Port Captaincies Coast Guard) 166- Premium rate services, max. 0.07 + 1.31/min 178- Premium rate services, max. 0.15 + 0.35/min 18- Customer care services 19- Customer care services 199- Premium rate services, max. 0.12 + 0.26/min 2- Reserved for future purposes 3- Mobile phone numbers 313- Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (GSM-R and internal numbers accessible from public network) 32x- Wind Italy mobile phones 33x- TIM mobile phones 34x- Vodafone Italy mobile phones 35x- Future full-MVNO mobile phones 36x- TIM mobile phones 37x- Various ESP/MVNO mobile phones 38x- Wind Italy mobile phones 39x- H3G Italy mobile phones 4- Internal phone and internet service numbers 5- VoIP numbers (implemented and accessible only by few operators) 6- Reserved for future purposes 7xx- Internet services 70x- Dial-up internet access 8- Special-rate numbers 80x- Toll-free numbers 84x- Shared-rate numbers (information services), max. 0.10 + local rate/min 89x- Premium-rate services (information and adult services) 892- Premium-rate services, max. 0.30 + 1.50/min 9- Reserved for future purposes
