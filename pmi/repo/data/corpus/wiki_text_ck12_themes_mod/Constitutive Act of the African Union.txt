The Constitutive Act of the African Union sets out the codified framework under which the African Union is to conduct itself. It was signed on 11 July 2000 at Lom, Togo. It entered into force after two thirds of the 53 signatory states ratified the convention. When a state ratifies the Constitutive Act, it formally becomes a member of the AU. All 53 signatory states have ratified the document. The only states in Africa that have neither signed nor ratified the document are Morocco and South Sudan. South Sudan has been admitted as a member of the AU but has not yet ratified the Constitutive Act.
