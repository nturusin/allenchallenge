Enderton also contributed to recursion theory, the theory of definability, models of analysis, computational complexity, and the history of logic. He earned his Ph.D. at Harvard in 1962. He was a member of the American Mathematical Society from 1961 until his death. He lived in Santa Monica. He married his wife, Cathy, in 1961 and they had two sons; Eric and Bert. From 1980 to 2002 he was coordinating editor of the reviews section of the Association for Symbolic Logic's Journal of Symbolic Logic. He died from leukemia in 2010. Enderton, Herbert B. (1977).
