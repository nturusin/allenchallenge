Transferrin saturation, abbreviated as TSAT and measured as a percentage, is a medical laboratory value. It is the ratio of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity, multiplied by 100. Of the transferrin that is available to bind iron, this value tells a clinician how much serum iron are actually bound. For instance, a value of 15% means that 15% of iron-binding sites of transferrin are being occupied by iron. For an explanation of some clinical situations in which this ratio is important, see Total iron-binding capacity. The three results are usually reported together. Normal reference ranges are: Serum iron: 60170 g/dl (1030mol/L) TIBC: 240450 g/dl Transferrin saturation: 1550% (males), 1245% (females) g/dl = micrograms per deciliter. Laboratories often use different units and "normal" may vary by population and the lab techniques used. Look at the individual laboratory reference values to interpret a specific test (for instance, your own).
