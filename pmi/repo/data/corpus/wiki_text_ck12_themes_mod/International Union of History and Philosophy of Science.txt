The International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology is one of the members of the International Council for Science (ICSU). It was founded in 1955 by merging the International Union of History of Science (IUHS) and the International Union of Philosophy of Science (IUPS), and consists of two divisions, the Division of History of Science and Technology (DHST) and the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science and Technology (DLMPST). The Division of History of Science and Technology (DHST) is an international non-governmental organisation devoted to international cooperation in the fields of logic and philosophy of science across the world. Together with the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science and Technology (DLMPST), the DHST forms one of the two divisions of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, representing the fields of logic, philosophy of science and history of science in the International Council for Science (ICSU). The DHST organizes an international congress every four years, and coordinates the activities of numerous commissions. The members of DHST are 98 national members (represented by national committees for the history of science) and 26 international scientific unions. 1st International Congress of History of Science: Paris, France, 1929 2nd International Congress of History of Science: London, England, 1931 See also 3rd International Congress of History of Science: Porto-Combra-Lisbon, Portugal, 1934 4th International Congress of History of Science: Prague, Czechoslovakia, 1937 5th International Congress of History of Science: Lausanne, Switzerland, 1947 6th International Congress of History of Science: Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1950 7th International Congress of History of Science: Jerusalem, Israel, 1953 8th International Congress of History of Science: Florence-Milan, Italy, 1956 9th International Congress of History of Science: Barcelona-Madrid, Spain, 1959 10th International Congress of History of Science: Ithaca, USA, 1962 11th International Congress of History of Science: Cracow, Poland, 1965 12th International Congress of History of Science: Paris, France, 1968 13th International Congress of History of Science: Moscow, USSR, 1971 14th International Congress of History of Science: Tokyo, Japan, 1974 15th International Congress of History of Science: Edinburgh, Scotland, 1977 16th International Congress of History of Science: Bucarest, Romania, 1981 17th International Congress of History of Science: Berkeley, USA, 1985 See also 18th International Congress of History of Science: Hamburg, Germany, 1989 19th International Congress of History of Science: Zaragoza, Spain, 1993 20th International Congress of History of Science: Lige, Belgium, 1997 21st International Congress of History of Science: Mexico City, Mexico, 2001 See also 22nd International Congress of History of Science: Beijing, China, 2005 23rd International Congress of History of Science and Technology: Budapest, Hungary, 2009 24th International Congress of History of Science, Technology and Medicine: Manchester, England, 2013 25th International Congress of History of Science and Technology: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2017 A map of past congresses can be found here.
