A high Earth orbit is a geocentric orbit with an altitude entirely above that of a geosynchronous orbit (35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi)). The orbital periods of such orbits are greater than twenty-four hours, therefore satellites in such orbits have an apparent retrograde motion that is, even if they are in a prograde orbit (90 > inclination >= 0), their orbital velocity is lower than Earth's rotational speed, causing their ground track to move westward on Earth's surface.
