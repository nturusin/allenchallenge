Electrochemical kinetics is a field of electrochemistry studying the rate of electrochemical processes. Due to electrochemical phenomena unfolding at the interface between an electrode and an electrolyte, there are accompanying phenomena to electrochemical reaction which contribute to the overall reaction rate. Contributors to this field are Alexander Frumkin, Max Volmer, Julius Tafel, etc. Vetter, Klaus J. (1967). Electrochemical kinetics; theoretical aspects. Academic Press.
