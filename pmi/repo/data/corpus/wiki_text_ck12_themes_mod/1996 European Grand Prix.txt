The 1996 European Grand Prix was a Formula One race held on April 28, 1996 at Nrburgring. Jacques Villeneuve scored his first Formula One victory in his fourth Formula One start. Both Benetton cars made extremely slow starts, due to the brakes locking on. Berger was forced to pit for fresh tyres after a flat-spot was caused, while Alesi finished lap 1 in 13th place and spun while trying to recover. The Tyrrells were disqualified for separate infringements - Salo finished 10th but his car was found post-race to be underweight, while Katayama finished 12th but was disqualified for receiving an illegal push-start on the parade lap. Lap leaders: Jacques Villeneuve 67 (1-67) Mika Hkkinen gained two pit lane speeding penalties due to a problem with his pit speed limiter. First point of the season for Martin Brundle. Bold text indicates who still has a theoretical chance of becoming World Champion. Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.
