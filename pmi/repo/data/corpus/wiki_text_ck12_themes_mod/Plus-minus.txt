Plusminus (+/, , plus/minus) is a sports statistic used to measure a player's impact on the game, represented by difference between their team's total scoring versus their opponent's. In ice hockey, it measures a player's goal differential. When an even-strength goal or shorthanded goal is scored, the plusminus statistic is increased by one ("plus") for those players on the ice for the team scoring the goal; the plusminus statistic is decreased by one ("minus") for those players on the ice for the team allowing the goal. Power play or penalty shot goals are excluded. An empty net does not matter for the calculation of plusminus. While the statistic officially measures a difference, it is sometimes (inaccurately) referred to as the plusminus ratio or plusminus rating. While a player's plusminus statistic is calculated for each game played, it tends to provide a more meaningful measure over a full season. The statistic is directly affected by overall team performance, influenced by both the offensive and defensive performance of the team as a whole. The NHL's Montreal Canadiens were the first team to track the plusminus of its players, starting sometime in the 1950s. Other teams followed in the early 1960s, and the NHL started officially compiling the statistic for the 196768 season. While Emile Francis is often credited with devising the system, he only popularized and adapted the system in use by the Canadiens. The NHL awarded the NHL Plus-Minus Award each year to the player with the highest plusminus statistic during the regular season from 198283 to 200708. The Western Hockey League (WHL) awards the WHL Plus-Minus Award each year to one of its players. Only four players have been multiple single-season leaders for the plusminus statistic: defenceman Bobby Orr led the league six times, Wayne Gretzky led the league four times, while John LeClair and Chris Pronger were two-time leaders. One player on the career top five list, Ray Bourque, was never a single-season leader, while all-time career leader Larry Robinson only set the single-season mark once. Two players on the season top five list, defencemen Bobby Orr and Dallas Smith, achieved their high mark playing as a defense tandem on the same 197071 Boston Bruins team. Since the NHL started tracking the plusminus statistic in the 196768 season, the top achievements have been: Top 5: Season high Bobby Orr, 197071, +124 Larry Robinson, 197677, +120 Wayne Gretzky, 198485, +98 Dallas Smith 197071, +94 Guy Lafleur, 197677, +89 Top 5: Career high Larry Robinson, career, +730 Bobby Orr, career, +597 Ray Bourque, career, +528 Wayne Gretzky, career, +518 Bobby Clarke, career, +506 Top 3: Season low Bill Mikkelson, 197475, 82 Jack Lynch, 197475, 69 Greg Joly, 197475, 68 Top 3: Career low Bob Stewart, career, 260 Don Lever, career, 240 Gary Croteau, career, 227 Top 2: Single game high Tom Bladon, Dec 11, 1977, +10 Theoren Fleury, Feb 10, 1993, +9 Although the statistic was pioneered in the sport of hockey, it has found its way into use in other sports and areas of life. For instance, the NBA's Houston Rockets first utilized a modified version of the stat, which helped reveal the unheralded effectiveness of light-scoring Shane Battier. It is now in regular use throughout the NBA.
