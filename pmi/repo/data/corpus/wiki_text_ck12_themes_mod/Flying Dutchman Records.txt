Flying Dutchman Records was an American jazz record label, which was owned by veteran music industry executive, producer and songwriter Bob Thiele. Initially distributed by Atlantic Records, Thiele made a five album deal in 1972 with Mega Records to issue five albums in the Flying Dutchman Series. The deal was not renewed and distribution shifted to RCA Records which took over the label in 1976. Some of the musicians who recorded several albums for the label include singer Leon Thomas, saxophonist Gato Barbieri, arranger Oliver Nelson, saxophonist Tom Scott and pianist Lonnie Liston Smith. Flying Dutchman had three sublabels, Amsterdam, BluesTime and Contact. Gil Scott-Heron released three albums for the label, including his debut Small Talk at 125th and Lenox and Free Will. Sony Music Entertainment now owns the Flying Dutchman catalog which is distributed by their Legacy Recordings label. 10101 Oliver Nelson & Steve Allen - Soulful Brass 10101 Oliver Nelson & Steve Allen - Soulful Brass #2 10102 Spontaneous Combustion - Come and Stick Your Head In 10103 Jon Appleton - Appleton Syntonic Menagerie 10104 Bob Thiele - Emergency - Head Start 10105 Stanley Crouch - Aint No Ambulances For No Nigguhs Tonight 10106 Tom Scott - Hair to Jazz 10107 Horace Tapscott - The Giant is Awakened 10108 John Carter & Bobby Bradford - Flight for Four 10109 Jimmy Gordon - Hog Fat 10110 Ron Anthony - Oh!
