G-protein coupled receptor 143 is a protein encoded by the GPR143 gene in humans. Ocular albinism type 1 protein is a conserved integral membrane protein with seven transmembrane domains. It is expressed in the eye and epidermal melanocytes. The GPR143 gene is regulated by the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. L-DOPA is an endogenous ligand for OA1. GPR143 has been shown to interact with GNAI1.
