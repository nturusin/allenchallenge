The International Island Games Association (IGA) is an organisation the sole purpose of which is to organise the Island Games, a friendly biennial athletic competition between teams from several European islands and other small territories. The IGA liaises with the member island associations and with sponsors of the games. It investigates whether islands wanting to join fit the membership criteria. Any further additions since Minorca joined in 2005 will now require changes to the constitution. The history of the Island Games and games results can be found at the Island Games page. The IGA was founded in the Isle of Man in 1985. Constituents come from islands in, or associated with, eight sovereign states (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). Current members of the IGA are: Gibraltar is the only member of the IGA that is not an island or group of islands as it is a peninsula of Iberia, sharing a land border with Spain. Ynys Mn (Anglesey), Frya and Hitra have bridge or tunnel connections to their mainland. Greenland is by far the largest island, and is bigger than all the rest combined, but is very sparsely populated. Former members of the IGA include the countries Iceland and Malta and the province Prince Edward Island.
