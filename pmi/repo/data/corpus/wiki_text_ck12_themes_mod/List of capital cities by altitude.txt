This is a list of national capitals ordered by altitude. The high elevation of the cities affects the social and physical arrangement of the place. In many cases, the cold climate in winter necessitates a particular style of habitat. Curiously, the first item in this list, Bolivia, is a country with multiple capitals - Sucre (constitutional capital) and La Paz (seat of government). If La Paz is considered the national capital, then Bolivia will be ranked as number one in the List, but if Sucre is specified, then the capital of Ecuador - Quito - will be the highest altitude national capital.
