Geophysical imaging (also known as geophysical tomography) is geophysical technique that investigates the subsurface. There are many different kinds of imaging techniques, all which are based on applied physics. Types of geophysical imaging: Electrical resistivity tomography Ground-penetrating radar Induced polarization Seismic tomography and Reflection seismology Magnetotellurics
