The NCAA Division II Field Hockey Championship is an annual single-elimination tournament conducted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the national champion of women's Division II collegiate field hockey in the United States. The tournament was held from 1981 and 1983, discontinued from 1984 and 1991, was re-instated in 1992, and has been held every year since. Between 1984 and 1991, when the Division II tournament was not held, Division II teams competed in the NCAA Division III Field Hockey Championship. The most successful team are the Bloomsburg Huskies, with thirteen titles. The Millersville Marauders are the current champions, winning the 2014 title against LIU Post. Teams from Pennsylvania have historically dominated the tournament. In every year that small college championships have been conducted (AIAW: 1979 to 1981, NCAA: 1981 to 2012), one or more teams from Pennsylvania have played in either or both Division II and Division III national title games, winning 29 of 38 such games. Currently, 6 teams compete in each national championship tournament. The first round is typically played on the campus of the higher-seeded teams. The semifinal and championship rounds are held at a pre-determined site. The 2014 finals were hosted by the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.
