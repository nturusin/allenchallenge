The Legend of Zelda is a video game series created by game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is developed and published by Nintendo. The series debuted in Japan with The Legend of Zelda (known in Japan as The Hyrule Fantasy: Zelda no Densetsu) on February 21, 1986, and was later released in North America (August 22, 1987) and Europe (November 27, 1987). The Legend of Zelda video games have been developed exclusively for Nintendo video game consoles and handhelds, dating from the Family Computer Disk System to the current generation of video game consoles. Spin-off titles, however, have been released on non-Nintendo systems. The franchise consists of 27 video games, including original titles, ports, and remakes. Over 52 million copies have been sold since the release of the first game. The franchise also includes a cartoon adaptation, multiple comic book adaptations, and soundtracks. The gameplay consists of a mixture of action, adventure, puzzle-solving, and role-playing video game. The series centers on Link, the main protagonist and character controlled by the player. Link is often given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda and the most common setting of the series, Hyrule, from Ganon, the series' primary antagonist. Other minor settings and antagonists have appeared throughout the series; Vaati has become one of the series' newer recurring antagonists. The games in The Legend of Zelda series with two-dimensional (2D) graphics feature side-scrolling or overhead view gameplay, while the games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics give the player a third-person perspective. The franchise holds several Guinness World Records, including first game with a battery-powered save feature and longest-running action-adventure series.
