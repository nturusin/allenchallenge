The Damkhler numbers (Da) are dimensionless numbers used in chemical engineering to relate the chemical reaction timescale (reaction rate) to the transport phenomena rate occurring in a system. It is named after German chemist Gerhard Damkhler. In its most commonly used form, the Damkhler number relates the reaction timescale to the convection times scale, flow rate, through the reactor for continuous or semibatch chemical processes: In reacting systems that include interphase mass transport, the second Damkhler number (DaII) is defined as the ratio of the chemical reaction rate to the mass transfer rate It is also defined as the ratio of the characteristic fluidic and chemical time scales: Since the reaction timescale is determined by the reaction rate, the exact formula for the Damkhler number varies according to the raw law equation. For a general chemical reaction A B of nth order, the Damkhler number for a convective flow system is defined as: where: k = kinetics reaction rate constant C0 = initial concentration n = reaction order = mean residence time or space time On the other hand, the second Damkhler number is defined as: where kg is the global mass transport coefficient a is the interfacial area The value of Da provides a quick estimate of the degree of conversion that can be achieved. As a rule of thumb, when Da is less than 0.1 a conversion of less than 10% is achieved,and when Da is greater than 10 a conversion of more than 90% is expected. The Karlovitz number is related to the Damkhler number by Da=1/Ka.
