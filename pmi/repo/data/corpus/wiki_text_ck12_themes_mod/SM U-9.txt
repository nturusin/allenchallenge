SM U-9 was a German Type U 9 U-boat. She was one of 329 submarines serving in the Imperial German Navy, and engaged in the commerce war (Handelskrieg) during World War I. Her construction was ordered on 000000001908-07-15-000015 July 1908 and her keel was laid down by Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig. She was launched on 000000001910-02-22-000022 February 1910 and commissioned on 000000001910-04-18-000018 April 1910 On 000000001914-07-16-000016 July 1914 the crew of U-9 reloaded her torpedo tubes while submerged, the first time any submarine had succeeded in doing so. On 000000001914-08-01-00001 August 1914, Kapitnleutnant Otto Weddigen took command. On 22 September, while patrolling the Broad Fourteens, a region of the southern North Sea, U-9 found a squadron of three obsolescent British Cressy-class armoured cruisers (HMS Aboukir, HMS Hogue, and HMS Cressy), (sardonically nicknamed the "Live Bait Squadron") which had been assigned to prevent German surface vessels from entering the eastern end of the English Channel. She fired four of her torpedoes, reloading while submerged, and sank all three in less than an hour. 1,459 British sailors died. It was one of the most notable submarine actions of all time. Members of the Admiralty who had considered submarines mere toys no longer expressed that opinion after this event. On 15 October, U-9 sank the protected cruiser HMS Hawke. On 000000001915-01-12-000012 January 1915, Johannes Spie relieved Weddigen, and commanded U-9 until 000000001916-04-19-000019 April 1916. During this period, she sank 13 ships totalling 8,635 GRT: 10 small fishing vessels and three British steamers (Don, Queen Wilhelmina and Serbino). After April 1916, she was withdrawn from front-line duties to be used for training. U-9 and the raider SMS Emden were the only ships which Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded an Iron Cross.
