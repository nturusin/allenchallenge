Arsenic acid is the chemical compound with the formula H3AsO4. More descriptively written as AsO(OH)3, this colorless acid is the arsenic analogue of phosphoric acid. Arsenate and phosphate salts behave very similarly. Arsenic acid as such has not been isolated, but only found in solution where it is largely ionized. Its hemihydrate form (H3AsO4H2O) does form stable crystals. Crystalline samples dehydrate with condensation at 100 C. It is a tetrahedral species of idealized symmetry C3v with AsO bonds lengths ranging from 1.66 to 1.71 . Being a triprotic acid, its acidity is described by three equilibria: H3AsO4 + H2O H2AsO 4 + H3O+ (K1 = 102.19) H2AsO 4 + H2O HAsO2 4 + H3O+ (K2 = 106.94) HAsO2 4 + H2O AsO3 4 + H3O+ (K3 = 1011.5) These Ka values are close to those for phosphoric acid. The highly basic arsenate ion (AsO3 4) is the product of the third ionization. Unlike phosphoric acid, arsenic acid is an oxidizer, illustrated by its ability to convert iodide to iodine. Arsenic acid is prepared by treating arsenic trioxide with concentrated nitric acid and dinitrogen trioxide is produced as a by-product. As2O3 + 2 HNO3 + 2 H2O 2 H3AsO4 + N2O3 The resulting solution is cooled to give colourless crystals of the hemihydrate H3AsO4H2O, although the dihydrate H3AsO42H2O is produced when crystallisation occurs at lower temperatures. Arsenic acid is slowly formed when arsenic pentoxide is dissolved in water, and when meta- or pyroarsenic acid is treated with cold water. Arsenic acid can also be prepared directly from elemental arsenic by moistening it and treating with ozone. 2 As + 3 H2O + 5 O3 2 H3AsO4 + 5 O2 Commercial applications of arsenic acid are limited by its toxicity. It has found occasional use as a wood preservative, broad-spectrum biocide, a finishing agent for glass and metal, and a reagent in the synthesis of some dyestuffs and organic arsenic compounds. The LD50 in rabbits is 6 mg/kg (0.006 g/kg).
