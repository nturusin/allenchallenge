eIF2B is a protein found in eukaryotes. It is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 and therefore converts the inactive eIF2-GDP to the active eIF2-GTP. This activation is hindered by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2, which leads to a stable eIF2-P-GDP-eIF2B complex and therefore inhibits translation initiation. Human genes which encode eIF-2B proteins include: EIF2B1 alpha subunit (26kDa) EIF2B2 beta subunit (39kDa) EIF2B3 gamma subunit (58kDa) EIF2B4 delta subunit (67kDa) EIF2B5 epsilon subunit (82kDa) ^ "eIF2B, a mediator of general and gene-specific translational control.".
