In mathematical analysis, Darboux's formula is a formula introduced by Gaston Darboux (1876) for summing infinite series by using integrals or evaluating integrals using infinite series. It is a generalization to the complex plane of the EulerMaclaurin summation formula, which is used for similar purposes and derived in a similar manner (by repeated integration by parts of a particular choice of integrand). Darboux's formula can also be used to derive the Taylor series of the calculus. If (t) is a polynomial of degree n and f an analytic function then The formula can be proved by repeated integration by parts. Taking to be a Bernoulli polynomial in Darboux's formula gives the EulerMaclaurin summation formula. Taking to be (t 1)n gives the formula for a Taylor series.
