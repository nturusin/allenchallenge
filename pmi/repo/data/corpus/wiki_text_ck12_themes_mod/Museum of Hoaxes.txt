The Museum of Hoaxes is a website created by Alex Boese in 1997 in San Diego, California as a resource for reporting and discussing hoaxes and urban legends, both past and present. In 2004, PC Magazine included the site as one of the "Top 100 Sites You Didn't Know You Couldn't Live Without," and Sci Fi Weekly named it "site of the week" for the week beginning 7 February 2007. Boese has published two books on hoaxes: Museum of Hoaxes (E.P. Dutton, 2002, ISBN 0-525-94678-0) and Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S. (Harvest Books, 2006, ISBN 0-15-603083-7). A third book by Boese, Elephants on Acid (Harvest Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-15-603135-6), focuses on unusual scientific experiments. His latest book is Electrified Sheep, published by Boxtree 2011, is also about strange scientific experiments.
