In music, a major fourth ( Play ) is the interval from the quarter tone scale, named by Ivan Wyschnegradsky, between the perfect fourth (500 cents) and the augmented fourth (600 cents) and thus 550 cents (F). It inverts to a minor fifth. The term may also be applied to the ratio 45:32 (F+) or 590.22 cents ( Play ), formed from the major third (5/4 = 386.31) and the major tone (9/8 = 203.91), which is flat of the ET tritone, which is 600 cents.
