Dennis Publishing Ltd. is an independent publisher founded in 1974. Felix Dennis started out in the magazine business in the late 1960s as one of the editors of the counterculture magazine OZ. In the mid-1970s, Dennis Publishing was born, beginning with a kung-fu magazine, Kung Fu monthly. Dennis followed this up in the early 1980s by publishing titles in the soon-to-be-lucrative computer enthusiast sector, including Your Spectrum (later renamed Your Sinclair and sold to Future Publishing). Dennis has since maintained a foothold in the computer magazine business - until Maxim's success in the US in the late 1990s, computer magazines were the mainstay of Dennis' magazine holdings, second only to Future Publishing in the UK. Dennis Publishing, Inc. publishes one of the most successful modern men's lifestyle magazines in America - Maxim (2.5 million rate base) - along with Stuff (1.3 million rate base) and general interest music magazine Blender (800,000 rate base). Maxim, Stuff and Blender are registered trademarks of Felix Dennis. On 5 February 2005, Maxim Radio was launched on Sirius Satellite Radio. On 12 November 2008, Sirius and XM merged, and 5 days later Sirius XM Stars Too debuted on Sirius Satellite Radio on Sirius 108 and XM 139. In May 2011, Stars Too moved to channel 104 on both services. On 15 February 2007, Dennis Publishing, Inc. announced that it had retained media investment firm, Allen & Company as its exclusive financial advisor to explore various strategic alternatives available to the Company including a possible sale of the Company. In June 2007, all of Dennis's United States holdings - minus the U.S. edition of The Week - were sold to the private equity firm Quadrangle Group, this included the editions of Maxim, Stuff & Blender.
