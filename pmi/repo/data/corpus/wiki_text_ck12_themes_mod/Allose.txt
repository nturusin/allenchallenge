Allose is an aldohexose sugar. It is a rare monosaccharide that occurs as a 6-O-cinnamyl glycoside in the leaves of the African shrub Protea rubropilosa. Extracts from the fresh-water alga Ochromas malhamensis contain this sugar but of unknown absolute configuration. It is soluble in water and practically insoluble in methanol. Allose is a C-3 epimer of glucose.
