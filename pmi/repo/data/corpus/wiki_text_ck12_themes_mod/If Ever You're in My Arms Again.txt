"If Ever You're in My Arms Again" is a 1984 popular song recorded by the American R&B singer Peabo Bryson. Released as a single from his album Straight from the Heart, the single peaked at #6 on the R&B chart and was Bryson's first Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at #10 during the summer of 1984. It also spent four weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart. The song was used as a love theme for the Kelly Capwell and Joe Perkins characters on the daytime serial Santa Barbara. Bryson would later have two more chart-topping singles on the adult contemporary chart: "A Whole New World", a duet with Regina Belle that was the theme to the film Aladdin; and "By the Time This Night Is Over", a song by saxophone player Kenny G, on which Bryson was the featured vocalist.
