The British Rail Class 201 (or 6S) six-car diesel-electric multiple units (DEMUs) were built in 1957-1958 at Eastleigh and Ashford. The Southern Region Class 201-207 DEMUs are nicknamed 'Thumpers' due to the noise they made while in motion. These units were built with a narrow body profile to accommodate the restricted tunnels on the London-Hastings line, for which they were built. Power car (two per six-car set) Introduced: 1957 Weight: 55 long tons (56 t; 62 short tons) Engine: English Electric 4-cylinder type 4SRKT Mark II of 600 shaft horsepower (450 kW) at 850 rpm (Equivalent to 1,000 bhp or 750 kW per 6-car set) Transmission: Electric, two English Electric type EE507 traction motors rated at 186 kW (249 hp) each. Maximum tractive effort: 12,500 lbf (56 kN) per car; 25,000 lbf (110 kN) per unit Driving wheel diameter: 40 in (1,016 mm) Driving Bogie; 42 in (1,067 mm) Trailer Bogie Coupling code: 'Buck-Eye' Type allowing coupling to any BR(S) 20x,4xx Units Train heating: Electric Original 6S Units Departmental Units Some units were disbanded during the mid 1960s to provide stock for the Class 206 'Tadpole' Units and to reform other 'Hastings Sets' after the Hither Green rail crash. Set 1002 was later reformed to its original formation in 1979, but set 1004 was reformed with only its original power cars and some trailers from sister Class 202 and 203 Hastings Sets. Set 1003 was reformed only for the last few months of Hastings DEMU service after its power cars were used for spares, again with none of its original trailers. Set 1007 also suffered a reformation in 1969 but it remained as a full six coach set until withdrawal in 1986. Most units were withdrawn and scrapped following electrification of the route in 1986. However, one complete unit, no. 1001, was preserved by Hastings Diesels Ltd., which is based at St Leonards-on-Sea. Vehicle no. 60000 has been named Hastings after the town which it previously worked to. This was mainline operational from the unit's revival in 1996 to 2006, but this motor coach was not prioritised when it needed fitting with Central Door Locking (CDL) & On-Train Monitoring Recorders (OTMR). 60000 also needed an overhaul to its bodywork and because of the costs involved, both financial and manpower, this work has not been carried out yet, which means it is currently in storage at St Leonards Depot. The two mainline certified motor coaches that are currently in use on the Hastings Diesel and are fitted with CDL and OTMR are 60116 Mountfield (certified in 2003) and 60118 Tunbridge Wells (certified in 1996). The unit operates several mainline railtours a year, starting from Hastings and going to various destinations across the South of England. Hastings Diesels Limited owns thirteen non-mainline certified vehicles which are in various states of readiness. Two of these are part restored trailer 60527 and unrestored motor coach 60001, which formed the motive power for the original unit 1001. They have said that there will be no serious work done to 60001 until work to motor coach 60019 is completed, as this one apparently needs less work done to it, which is cheaper, and returning 60000 Hastings to front line service is also finished.
