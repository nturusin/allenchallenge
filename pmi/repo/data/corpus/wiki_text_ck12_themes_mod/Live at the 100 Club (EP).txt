Live at the 100 Club is the second EP from Welsh band The Automatic. The EP was recorded at London's 100 Club by Coca-Cola and iTunes and is available exclusively through iTunes. On the night the band also played a number of other songs including "Gold Digger" and "Recover". The iTunes EP originally contained 5 songs, however mysteriously That's what She Said disappeared from the EP sometime in early 2007. iTunes and Coca Cola launched a competition in conjunction with the 100 Club gig, for fans of The Automatic to win an iPod, signed posters, T-shirts, CDs and lanyards with free downloads for iTunes. For a limited time Coca Cola allowed iTunes users to download a single song from the EP for free by obtaining a code from Coca-Cola's music website.
