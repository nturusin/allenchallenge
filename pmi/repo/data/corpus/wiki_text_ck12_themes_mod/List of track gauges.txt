This list presents an overview of railway track gauges by size. A gauge is measured between the inner faces of the rails. For ridable miniature railways and minimum gauge railways, the gauges are overlapping. There are also some extreme narrow gauge railways listed. See: Distinction between a ridable miniature railway and a minimum gauge railway for clarification. Model railway gauges are covered in rail transport modelling scales. Railways with a track gauge between 500 mm (19 34 in) and 4 ft 8 12 in (1,435 mm) standard gauge.
