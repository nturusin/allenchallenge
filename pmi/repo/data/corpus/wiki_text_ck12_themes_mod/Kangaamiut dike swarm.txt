The Kangaamiut dike swarm (old spelling: Kangmiut) is a 2.04 billion year old dike swarm located in the Kangerlussuaq region of western Greenland. The dikes cut Archean orthogneisses and are exposed along approximately 150 km (93 mi) of the coast and a similar distance up to the inland ice to the east, covering an area of about 18,000 km2 (6,900 sq mi). To the north it is bounded by the paleoproterozoic Ikertooq shear zone (old spelling: Ikertq) while to the south the boundary is gradational with a gradual reduction in the density of dikes.
