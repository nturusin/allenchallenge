The Climate Institute of Australia is a policy think-tank established in 2005 to encourage progressive policies for managing climate change in Australia. The board consists of a mixture of both academics and business people drawn from rural, scientific and business backgrounds. Funding for the Institute is provided by the Poola Foundation's Tom Kantor fund. The current cycle of funding is for five years at a rate of approximately A$2 million per annum. Recent research work by the institute includes modelling Australia's ability to reach Kyoto protocol targets, and examining the financial impacts of delayed climate change action. The Institute also runs a large community consultation program which has examined issues such as Australian religious groups position on Climate Change. A 2007 report published by the Institute highlighted the increased risks from extreme bushfire seasons.
