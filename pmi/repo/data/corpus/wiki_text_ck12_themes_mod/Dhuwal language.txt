Dhuwal (Dual, Duala) is a dialect cluster of the Australian Aboriginal Yolu language, spoken in Australia's Northern Territory. All varieties of Yolu are mutually intelligible to some extent. Dialects of the Yirritja moiety are (a) Gupapuyngu and Gumatj; those of the Dhuwa moiety are (b) Djambarrpuyngu, Djapu, Liyagalawumirr, and Guyamirlili (Gwijamil). In addition, it would appear that the Dhay'yi (Dayi) dialects, (a) Dhalwangu and (b) Djarrwark, are part of the same language. Ethnologue divides Dhuwal into four languages, plus Dayi. Dhuwal proper (Wulamba), Datiwuy, Dhuwaya, Liyagawumirr, Marrangu, and Djapu: 600 speakers Djampbarrpuyu, 2,760 speakers Gumatj, 240 speakers Gupapuyngu, 330 speakers Dhay'yi (Dayi) and Dhalwangu, 170 speakers Numbers are from the 2006 census. Probably every Australian language with speakers remaining has had an orthography developed for it, in each case in the Latin script. Sounds not found in English are usually represented by digraphs, or more rarely by diacritics, such as underlines, or extra symbols, sometimes borrowed from the International Phonetic Alphabet. Some examples are shown in the following table.
