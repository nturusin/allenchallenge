Cadambur Tiruvenkatachari Rajagopal (September 8, 1903 April 25, 1978) was an Indian mathematician. Rajagopal was born in Triplicane, Madras, India. He was the first son of Tiruvenkatachari and Padmammal. He had two younger brothers, C.T. Venugopal, a distinguished civil servant, and C. T. K. Chari. They also had a young sister, Kamala. He studied at Presidency College and graduated with an Honours in mathematics in 1925. He was involved in the clerical service and then taught mathematics at Annamalai University. Rajagopal taught mathematics at Madras Christian College from 1931 to 1951. He joined the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics in 1951 and became its head in 1955. He helped the institute to became India's leading mathematics research centre. The Institute now comes under the University of Madras, after it was merged with the Department of Mathematics at the University in 1967. Rajagopal conducted research on sequences, series, summability and, and published more than 80 papers but is most noted for his work in the area of generalising and unifying Tauberian theorems. He also did research in many other mathematical topics. Rajagopal also conducted research in the history of medieval Indian mathematics. He showed that the series for tan1x discovered by James Gregory and those for sin x and cos x discovered by Isaac Newton were known to the Hindu mathematicians 150 years earlier. He identified Madhava as the first discoverer of these series.
