This is a list of the mammal species recorded in South Ossetia. The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the IUCN: Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of near threatened and least concern categories: = Suborder: Sciurognathi Family: Sciuridae (squirrels) Subfamily: Sciurinae Tribe: Sciurini Genus: Sciurus Caucasian squirrel Sciurus anomalus LR/nt ********** Subfamily: Xerinae Tribe: Marmotini Genus: Spermophilus Caucasian mountain ground squirrel Spermophilus musicus LR/lc ******** Little ground squirrel Spermophilus pygmaeus LR/lc Family: Gliridae (dormice) Subfamily: Leithiinae Genus: Dryomys Forest dormouse Dryomys nitedula LR/nt Subfamily: Glirinae Genus: Glis Edible dormouse Glis glis LR/nt Family: Dipodidae (jerboas) Subfamily: Allactaginae Genus: Allactaga Small five-toed jerboa Allactaga elater LR/lc Subfamily: Sicistinae Genus: Sicista Northern birch mouse Sicista betulina LR/nt Caucasian birch mouse Sicista caucasica LR/lc Kazbeg birch mouse Sicista kazbegica DD Family: Cricetidae Subfamily: Cricetinae Genus: Cricetus European hamster Cricetus cricetus LR/lc Ciscaucasian hamster Mesocricetus raddei LR/lc ******** Subfamily: Arvicolinae Genus: Chionomys Caucasian snow vole Chionomys gud LR/nt Robert's snow vole Chionomys roberti LR/nt Genus: Ellobius Transcaucasian mole vole Ellobius lutescens LR/lc ********* Genus: Microtus Altai vole Microtus obscurus LR/lc Family: Muridae (mice, rats, voles, gerbils, hamsters, etc.) Subfamily: Murinae Genus: Apodemus Striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius LR/lc Yellow-breasted field mouse Apodemus fulvipectus LR/lc Black Sea field mouse Apodemus ponticus LR/lc Ural field mouse Apodemus uralensis LR/lc Genus: Micromys Harvest mouse Micromys minutus LR/nt = The order Erinaceomorpha contains a single family, Erinaceidae, which comprise the hedgehogs and gymnures.
