Mitochondrially encoded tRNA asparagine also known as MT-TN is a transfer RNA which in humans is encoded by the mitochondrial MT-TN gene. MT-TN is a small 73 nucleotide RNA (human mitochondrial map position 5657-5729) that transfers the amino acid asparagine to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosome site of protein synthesis during translation.
