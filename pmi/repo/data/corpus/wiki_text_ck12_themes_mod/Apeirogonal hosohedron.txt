In geometry, an apeirogonal hosohedron or infinite hosohedronis a tiling of the plane consisting of two vertices at infinity. It may be considered an improper regular tiling of the Euclidean plane, with Schlfli symbol {2,}. The apeirogonal hosohedron is the arithmetic limit of the family of hosohedra {2,p}, as p tends to infinity, thereby turning the hosohedron into a Euclidean tiling. Similarly to the uniform polyhedra and the uniform tilings, eight uniform tilings may be based from the regular apeirogonal tiling. The rectified and cantellated forms are duplicated, and as two times infinity is also infinity, the truncated and omnitruncated forms are also duplicated, therefore reducing the number of unique forms to four: the apeirogonal tiling, the apeirogonal hosohedron, the apeirogonal prism, and the apeirogonal antiprism.
