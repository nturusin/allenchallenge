Euarchontoglires (synonymous with Supraprimates) is a clade and a superorder of mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, colugos and primates (including humans). The Euarchontoglires clade is based on DNA sequence analyses and retrotransposon markers, combining the Glires clade, which consists of Rodentia and Lagomorpha, with that of Euarchonta, a clade consisting of Scandentia, Primates and Dermoptera. So far, few if any anatomical features supporting Euarchontoglires have been recognized, but neither is there strong evidence from anatomy to support alternative hypotheses. Euarchontoglires is now recognized as one of the four major clades within the clade Eutheria, containing placentalia (placental mammals), and it is usually discussed without a taxonomic rank but has been assigned those of cohort or magnorder and superorder. Relations between the four cohorts (Euarchontoglires, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, and Afrotheria) and the identity of the placental root, remain somewhat controversial. Euarchontoglires probably split from the Laurasiatheria sister group about 85 to 95 million years ago, during the Cretaceous, developing in the Laurasian island group that would later become Europe. This hypothesis is supported by molecular evidence; so far, the earliest known fossils date to the early Paleocene. The clade of Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria is recognized as Boreoeutheria. Both Euarchontoglires and diprotodont marsupials are documented to possess a vermiform appendix, although this evolved as a result of convergent evolution. The hypothesized relationship among the Euarchontoglires is as follows: One study based on DNA analysis suggests that Scandentia and Primates are sister clades, but did not discuss the position of Dermoptera.
