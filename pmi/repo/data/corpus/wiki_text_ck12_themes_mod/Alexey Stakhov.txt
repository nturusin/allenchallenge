Stakhov, Alexey Petrovich (Russian: , Ukrainian: , ) born (May 7, 1939) Ukrainian mathematician, inventor and engineer, who has made contributions to the theory of Fibonacci numbers and the "Golden Section" and their applications in computer science and measurement theory and technology. Doctor of Computer Science (1972), Professor (1974). Author of over 500 publications, 14 books and 65 international patents. Born May 7, 1939 in Partizany, Kherson region, Ukraine, USSR. In 1956 graduated with honours from of Rivne village high school. Same year became a student of the Mining Faculty of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute (now the National Technical University of Ukraine Kiev Polytechnic Institute). In 1959, transferred to the Radio Engineering Faculty of Kharkiv Aviation Institute (now the National Aerospace University of Ukraine). After graduation, worked for two years as an engineer in the Kharkiv Electrical Instrument Design Bureau (now the space technology company Khartron). "Khartron" was one of the top secret space companies of the Soviet Union. It was engaged in the research, development and manufacture of automatic control systems for missiles and space craft on board systems. Through working there Stakhov obtained thorough practical engineering experience and published his first scientific papers. Later he worked at the universities of Russia and Ukraine (Kharkiv Institute of Radio Electronics, Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute, Technical University of Vinnitsa, Vinnitsa Agricultural University, Vinnitsa Pedagogic University). He was a visiting professor at many universities abroad (Austria, Germany, Libya, Mozambique). Since 2004 lives and works in Canada. Dean of the Faculty of Computer Engineering of the Kharkiv Institute of Radio Electronics (now, Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics), 19681970 Head of the Department of Informational and Measuring Engineering, Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute, 19711977 Head of the Department of Computer Engineering, Vinnitsa Polytechnic Institute (now Vinnitsa National Technical University), 19771988 Director of the Special Design and Technological Bureau "Module" of the Vinnitsa Polytechnic Institute, 19861989 Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computing Systems, Vinnitsa Technical University, 19891996 Head of the Department of Computer Science, Vinnitsa State Agricultural University (now Vinnitsa National Agrarian University), 19972004 Member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Canada (2005) Professor Emeritus of Taganrog University of Radio Engineering Since 2003, President of the International Club of the Golden Section, and from 2005, Director of the Golden Section Institute, Academy of Trinitarizm (Russia). Initiated the creation of the so-called "Slavic Golden Group" (Kiev, 1992) and was Scientific Director of the International Congress on the Mathematics of Harmony (Odessa, 2010). In 2009 he was awarded the Medal "Knight of Arts and Sciences" (Russian Academy of Natural Sciences) Created a new direction in the measurement theory, the algorithmic measurement theory described in his book A.P. Stakhov. "Introduction into Algorithmic Measurement Theory" (Moscow: Soviet Radio, 1977). Created the theory of the redundant number systems based on the generalised Fibonacci numbers (Fibonacci p-codes) and the generalised golden proportions (codes of the golden p-proportion) The principals of the Fibonacci p-codes and the new computer arithmetic based on them are described in his book A.P. Stakhov. "Introduction into Algorithmic Measurement Theory" (Moscow: Soviet Radio, 1977). The fundamentals of the theory of the codes of the golden p-proportion are stated in the book AP Stakhov. The Codes of the Golden Proportion (Moscow, Radio and Communication, 1984). Put forward the concept of "Fibonacci computers". The international priority of this invention was protected by the Soviet Union in an unprecedented patenting operation by Soviet standards, resulting in 65 international patents, covering the territories of U.S.A, Japan, U.K., France, Germany, Canada and other countries. Elaborated and evolved the concept "Mathematics of Harmony", which goes back in its foundations to Euclid's Elements (III c. BC), "Divina Proportione" (Divine proportion) by Luca Pacioli (1509), Harmonice Mundi (Harmony of the World) by Johannes Kepler (1619). For the first time the concept of "Mathematics of Harmony" in relation to the achievements of modern science was presented by Prof. Stakhov in a speech "The Golden Section and Modern Harmony Mathematics," made at the 7th International Conference "Fibonacci Numbers and Their Applications" (Austria, Graz, 1996). The book "The Mathematics of Harmony. From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science" 748 pages (World Scientific, 2009) is Stakhovs main scientific achievement in this field. Published over 500 scientific works, among them 14 books, 65 international patents, 130 USSR invention certificates. During his work in Canada (20042012) published over 30 articles in international journals (Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, Applied Mathematics, Arc Combinatoria, Visual Mathematics, etc.). Alexey Stakhov prepared 30 PhD students, five of Stakhovs PhD students, became Doctors of Sciences. The work as "Visiting Professor": Vienna Technical University (Austria, 1976) University of Jena (Germany, 1986) Dresden Technical University (Germany, 1988) Al Fateh University (Tripoli, Libya, 19951997) University of Eduardo Mondlane (Maputo, Mozambique, 19982000) Awarded for the best scientific publication by Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (1980) Barkhausens Commemorative Medal issued by the Dresden Technical University as "Visiting Professor" of Heinrich Barkhausen Department (1988) The 2000 Millennium Medal of Honour, issued by the American Biographical Institute Professor Emeritus of Taganrog University of Radio Engineering (2004) The honorary title of "Knight of Arts and Sciences" (Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, 2009) The honorary title "Doctor of the Sacred Geometry in Mathematics" (American Society of the Golden Section, 2010) Prof. Alexey Stakhov has been included in the Encyclopedia Famous Scientists of Russia Stakhov AP.
