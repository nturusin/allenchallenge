The name Mil (Chinese: ; pinyin: m l; "detailed (approximation) ratio"), also known as Zul (Zu's ratio), is given to an approximation to (pi) found by Chinese mathematician and astronomer Z Chngzh (). He computed to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927 and gave two rational approximations of , 22/7 and 355/113, naming them respectively Yuel (approximate ratio) and Mil. 355/113 is the best rational approximation of with a denominator of four digits or fewer, being accurate to 6 decimal places. It is within 0.000009% of the value of , or in terms of common fractions overestimates by less than 1/3 748 629. The next rational number (ordered by size of denominator) that is a better rational approximation of is 52 163/16 604, still only correct to 6 decimal places and hardly closer to than 355/113. To be accurate to 7 decimal places, one needs to go as far as 86 953/27 678. For 8, we need 102 928/32 763. An easy mnemonic helps memorize this useful fraction by writing down each of the first three odd numbers twice: 1 1 3 3 5 5, then dividing the decimal number represented by the last 3 digits by the decimal number given by the first three digits. Zu's contemporary calendarist and mathematician He Chengtian () invented a fraction interpolation method called "harmonization of the divisor of the day" to obtain a closer approximation by iteratively adding the numerators and denominators of a "weak" fraction and a "strong" fraction. Zu Chongzhi's approximation 355/113 can be obtained with He Chengtian's method
