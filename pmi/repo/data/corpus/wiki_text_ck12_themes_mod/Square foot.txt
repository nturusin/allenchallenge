The square foot (plural square feet; abbreviated ft2 or sq ft) is an imperial unit and U.S. customary unit (non-SI, non-metric) of area, used mainly in the United States and partially in Canada, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. It is defined as the area of a square with sides of 1 foot. A symbol for square foot, square feet, and "per square foot" commonly used in architecture, real estate and interior space plans is a simple square with a vertical line bisecting it. It is also occasionally written as a square with a slash through it. To calculate the Square footing of an area, multiply the length of one side of a regular quadrilateral multiplied by the length of an adjacent side (for example, a rectangle of 0.5 foot by 2 foot would cover 1 square foot). 1 square foot is equivalent to: 144 square inches (Sq In) 1/9 square yards (Sq Yd) 0.09290304 square metres (symbol: m2)
