The British Rail Class 466 Networker electric multiple units were built by GEC Alsthom (Metro-Cammell) between 1993 and 1994, which operates with Class 465 EMUs in southeast London and Kent on the Southeastern network. It is a member of the Networker family of trains. The Class 466 EMUs were built between 1993 and 1994 by GEC Alsthom in Birmingham, for the Network SouthEast sector of British Rail. They were inherited by Connex South Eastern and its successors South Eastern Trains and currently Southeastern. Each of these units is formed of 2 coaches that have dimensions of 20.89 m 2.81 m (68 ft 6 in 9 ft 3 in) and a top speed of 75 mph (121 km/h). There are just 43 units, numbered 466001 to 466043. Class 466 units are used by Southeastern Metro routes in multiple with Class 465/0, Class 465/1, Class 465/2 and other Class 466 units. Additionally, Class 466 units are now also operating on outer suburban routes with Class 465/9 units, although quite a few routes are being replaced with Class 375 Electrostars. They are also used as individual units on rural routes, mainly the Sheerness Line between Sittingbourne and Sheerness, displacing the Class 508/2s which operated on this branch line and on the Bromley North branch between Grove Park and Bromley North. The Class 466s were also used on the Medway Valley Line between Strood, Maidstone West and Tonbridge, and in the leaf fall and winter season of 2011, the Class 466s were doubled up to make 4 car units on the Medway Valley Line to help stop the poor adhesion along the line when only a single unit runs. They also ran doubled up or coupled with a Class 465 on the Sheerness Line during the winters of 2009/10 and 2010/11. From the May 2012 timetable changes, Class 375s replaced the Class 466s on the Medway Valley Line. The units that replaced them were three car Class 375/3s and occasionally four car Class 375s are used when the three coach units are unavailable. Since the 375/3s replaced the 466s on the Medway Valley Line, rare sightings of 466s operating on the line in place of Electrostars have been seen. These two-car EMUs are formed of a driving motor carriage (DMOS: Driving Motor Open Standard) and a driving trailer carriage (DTOSL: Driving Trailer Open Standard Lavatory); all on board seating is standard accommodation. A Solid State Traction Converter package controls 3-phase AC Traction motors, which allows for Rheostatic or Regenerative Dynamic braking. Primary braking system is electro-pneumatically actuated disc brakes, which is blended with the Dynamic brakes. Speed Probes on every axle of the unit provide for Wheel Slip/Slide Protection. A solid state Auxiliary Converter provides 110 V DC and 240 V AC supplies; this is the source of the loud buzzing noise which can be heard when the train is stationary. The Aux Converter is located on the driving trailer, along with the toilet. The units use air-operated sliding plug doors. There are a total of 43 Class 466 EMUs on the UK rail network. These are all owned by Angel Trains, leased and operated by Southeastern. All these units have recently been fitted with new information boards with automatic announcements. The 466s were repainted at Wabtec Rail, Doncaster into a variation of Southeastern's new livery, which is identical to the livery the 465/0s & /1s received. All 43 units in the fleet are now in the new livery with lilac doors and midnight blue lower band. The 465/2s and /9s are also being repainted into the same livery. Some 465/2s and /9s still have not received the livery and are still being sent up to Doncaster for refurbishment to this day. Class 66 locos are used to haul the units to Doncaster. From the RAIB report: On 5 February 2007 a bridge inspection unit working on the M20 was deployed over a railway bridge between Maidstone Barracks and Aylesford stations. The gantry on the bridge inspection unit was struck by a scheduled passenger train, causing significant damage to the leading carriage and wrecking the gantry. The train driver and the sole passenger were slightly injured. Nobody was on the gantry at the time. At 22:25 hrs on 5 February 2007 Southeastern train 2T83, the 21:57 hrs Paddock Wood to Gillingham (Kent) struck the "Moog" gantry which was foul of the up line. The train was a 2 car electric unit of class 466 (466041) and was carrying a driver and one passenger. The collision speed was 65 mph (105 km/h). The leading carriage suffered substantial damage to the cab and forward saloon areas. The driving cab roof was ripped open at the right hand side.
