UltraBrowser is a graphical web browser developed by UltraBrowser.com Inc, based upon the Trident layout engine, part of Internet Explorer since IE version 4. The program is lightweight and features an advanced GUI which features various links, channels and search facilities. The latest version was released on May 19, 2005. Aside from their self-branded browser, the company also specialises in custom-branded browsers for companies and organisations. One of their most notable clients was Tiscali SpA, in which the two companies signed a contract to produce a Tiscali-branded browser which later became known as Tiscali 10.0, released in 2002. One of UltraBrowser's major user interface features is the interchangeable skins, one of which is downloaded as part of the default installation. However, more skins are available from UltraBrowser's website. The GUI also features links and channels to various portals and online facilities, such as search engines, online mail, translation tools and various online messengers. Since the program relies on Trident technology, many of the settings available in the browser are similar to those of Internet Explorer.
