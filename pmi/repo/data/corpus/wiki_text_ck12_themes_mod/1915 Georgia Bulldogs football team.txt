The 1915 Georgia Bulldogs football team represented the Georgia Bulldogs of the University of Georgia during the 1915 college football season. The Bulldogs completed the season with a 522 record. Tennessee-Chattanooga joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) in 1914, so the 1915 game was a conference game. Due to the loss to Auburn, Georgia finished 312 in the SIAA. The only blemish on in-state rival Georgia Tech's record was a scoreless tie with Georgia. John G. Henderson headed a group of three men, one behind the other with his hands upon the shoulders of the one in front, to counter Heisman's jump shift offense.
