Butyronitrile or butanenitrile or propyl cyanide, is a nitrile with the formula C3H7CN. This colorless liquid is miscible with most polar organic solvents. It is mainly used as a precursor to the poultry drug amprolium. Butyronitrile is prepared industrially by the ammoxidation of n-butanol: C3H7CH2OH + NH3 + O2 C3H7CN + 3 H2O Butyronitrile has been detected in the Large Molecule Heimat.
