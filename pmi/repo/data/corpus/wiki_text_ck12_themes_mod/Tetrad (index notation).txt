In Riemannian geometry, we can introduce a coordinate system over the Riemannian manifold (at least, over a chart), giving n coordinates for an n-dimensional manifold. Locally, at least, this gives a basis for the 1-forms, dxi where d is the exterior derivative. The dual basis for the tangent space T is ei. Now, let's choose an orthonormal basis for the fibers of T. The rest is index manipulation. Take a 3-sphere with the radius R and give it polar coordinates , , . e(e)/R, e(e)/R sin() and e(e)/R sin() sin() form an orthonormal basis of T. Call these e1, e2 and e3. Given the metric , we can ignore the covariant and contravariant distinction for T. Then, the dreibein (triad), . So, . from the relation , we get . (dA=0 tells us A is antisymmetric) So, ,
