The Apple Icon Image format is the icon format used in Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X. It supports icons of 16 16, 32 32, 48 48, 128 128, 256 256, 512 512, and 1024 1024 pixels, with both 1- and 8-bit alpha channels and multiple image states (example: open and closed folders). The fixed-size icons can be scaled by the operating system and displayed at any intermediate size. The file format consists of an 8 byte header, followed by any number of icons. Over time the format has been improved and there is support for compression of some parts of the pixel data. The 32-bit ("is32", "il32", "ih32","it32") pixel data is often compressed (per channel) with a format similar to PackBits. Some sources mentioned that the OS supports both compressed or uncompressed data chunks. the values inside the brackets () in the length column is the uncompressed length.
