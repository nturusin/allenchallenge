Cobamamide (AdoCbl), which is also known as adenosylcobalamin and dibencozide, is, along with methylcobalamin (MeCbl), one of the active forms of vitamin B12. As a nutritional supplement, it is available in tabletted form, but unlike cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin, it is not available in injectable form. An enzyme that uses adenosylcobalamin as a cofactor is methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM).
