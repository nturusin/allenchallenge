A convection microwave is a combination of a standard microwave oven and a convection oven. It allows food cooked in the convection microwave to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped as in a convection oven. However, most cakes cannot be baked in a microwave oven - only those without an open grain structure, such as brownies. There are microwaves which contain electric browning baking elements. A true convection microwave has a high velocity forced air fan to circulate the hot air uniformly. Convection microwave ovens were initially considered to be high-end kitchen appliances. Over time their price has dropped, and they can be bought for around the same price as a conventional oven. However, some models do require more space than a standard microwave, because of the larger cooking area inside. Companies such as Wolf, GE, Sharp, Samsung, Panasonic, LG, Bellini, and Daewoo all currently produce convection microwaves.
