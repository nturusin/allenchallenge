Amiloride-sensitive cation channel 3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ACCN3 gene. This gene encodes a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) superfamily. The members of this family are amiloride-sensitive sodium channels that contain intracellular N and C termini, two hydrophobic transmembrane regions, and a large extracellular loop, which has many cysteine residues with conserved spacing. The member encoded by this gene is an acid sensor and may play an important role in the detection of lasting pH changes. In addition, a heteromeric association between this member and ACCN1 has been observed as proton-gated channels sensitive to gadolinium. Alternative splicing of this gene generates three transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. ACCN3 has been shown to interact with LIN7B, GOPC and MAGI1.
