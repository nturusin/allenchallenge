Rhus chinensis, the Chinese sumac or nutgall tree, is a plant species in the genus Rhus. The species is used to produce galls, called Chinese gall, Galla Chinensis or Wu Bei Zi () in Chinese, which are rich in gallotannins, a type of hydrolysable tannins. The infestation by Chinese sumac aphids (Melaphis chinensis Bell) can lead to a gall which is valued as a commercial product. Chinese galls are used in Chinese medicine to treat coughs, diarrhea, night sweats, dysentery and to stop intestinal and uterine bleeding. Rhus chinensis compounds possess strong antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiarrheal and antioxidant activities. The gall of Rhus chinensis, Galla chinensi, has long been considered to possess many medicinal properties. Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid),isolated from Rhus chinensis, induces apoptosis in human monocytic lymphoma cell line U937 and may be a potential chemotherapeutic agent against lymphoma. The gall of Rhus chinensis inhibits alpha-glucosidase activity.
