An en is a typographic unit, half of the width of an em. By definition, it is equivalent to half of the height of the font (e.g. in 16 point type it is 8 points). As its name suggests, it is also traditionally the width of an uppercase letter "N". The en dash () and en space () are each one en wide. In English, the en dash is commonly used for inclusive ranges (e.g., "pages 1217" or "August 7, 1988 November 26, 2005"), and increasingly to replace the long dash ("", also called an em dash). (Note that when using it to replace a long dash, spaces are needed either side of it like so.)
