The NCAA Women's Division I Swimming and Diving Championships is an annual college championship in the United States. The meet is typically held on the second-to-last weekend (Thursday-Saturday) in March, and consists of individual and relay events for female swimmers and divers at Division I schools. The swimming-portion of the meet takes place in a 25-yard pool, except in 2000 and 2004 which swam in a 25-meter course. Swimming was one of twelve women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981-82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA conquered the AIAW and usurped its authority and membership.
