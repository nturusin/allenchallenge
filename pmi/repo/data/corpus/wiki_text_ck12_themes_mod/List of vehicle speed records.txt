The following is a list of speed records for various categories of vehicles. In any category, as with many world records, there may be some dispute over the criteria for a record-setting event, the authority of the organization certifying the record, the identity of the record holder, and the actual speed achieved. 1.^ Unofficial helicopter speed records by the Sikorsky X2 (460 km/h on 15 September 2010) and the Eurocopter X3 (472 km/h on 7 June 2013) would surpass this record if accepted. 2.^ A ground effect vehicle (a.k.a. "Wing-In-Ground effect vehicle") is classified as a maritime ship by the International Maritime Organization. In order to unambiguously express the speed of a spacecraft, a frame of reference must be specified. Typically, this frame will be fixed to the celestial body with the largest gravitational influence on the spacecraft, often the Earth or the Sun.
