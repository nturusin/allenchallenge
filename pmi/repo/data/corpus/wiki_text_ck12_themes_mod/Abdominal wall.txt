In anatomy, the abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls. There is a common set of layers covering and forming all the walls: the deepest being the extraperitoneal fat, the parietal peritoneum, and a layer of fascia, which has different names according to what it covers (e.g., transversalis, psoas fascia). In medical vernacular, the abdominal wall most commonly refers to the layers composing the anterior abdominal wall which, in addition to the layers mentioned above, includes the three layers of muscle: the transversus abdominis (transverse abdominal muscle), the internal (obliquus internus) and the external oblique (obliquus externus). In human anatomy, the layers of the abdominal wall are (from superficial to deep): Skin Subcutaneous tissue Fascia Camper's fascia - fatty superficial layer. Scarpa's fascia - deep fibrous layer.
