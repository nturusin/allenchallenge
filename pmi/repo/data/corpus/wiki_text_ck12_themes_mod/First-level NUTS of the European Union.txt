The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, (NUTS, for the French nomenclature d'units territoriales statistiques), is a geocode standard for referencing the administrative divisions of countries for statistical purposes. The standard was developed by the European Union. There are three levels of NUTS defined, with two levels of local administrative units (LAUs) below. Not all countries have every level of division, depending on their size. One of the most extreme cases is Luxembourg, which has only LAUs; the three NUTS divisions each correspond to the entire country itself. Below are the first level NUTS regions of the European Union.
