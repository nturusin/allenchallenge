This is a list of assemblers: computer programs that translate ("assemble") assembly language source code into binary programs. GNU Assembler (gas): GPL: many target instruction sets including ARM architecture, Atmel AVR, x86, Freescale 68HC11, Freescale v4e, Motorola 68k, MIPS, PowerPC, IBM System z, TI MSP430, Zilog Z80. ASxxxx Cross Assembler (part of the Small Device C Compiler project): GPL: several target instruction sets including Intel 8051, Zilog Z80, Freescale 68HC08, PIC microcontroller. Vasm portable and retargetable assembler: Target instruction sets including 680x0, Coldfire, PowerPC, C16x/ST10, 6502, Zilog Z80. The Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK) targets many architectures of the 1980s, including 6502, 6800, 680x0, ARM, x86, Zilog Z80 and Z8000. ^ Part of the Minix 3 source tree, but without obvious development activity. The full source history is available. ^ Developed by Interactive in 1986 when they ported System V to Intel iAPX286 and 80386 architectures. Archetypical of ATT syntax because it was used as reference for GAS. Still used for The SCO Group's products, UnixWare and OpenServer. ^ Home site does not appear active any more. Also offered as part of FreeBSD Ports, in bcc-1995.03.12. ^ Active and supported, but not advertised. ^ Developed in 1982 at MIT as a cross-assembler, it was picked up by Interactive in 1983 when they developed PC/IX under IBM contract. The syntax was later used as base for ACK assembler, to be used in Minix 1.x toolchain. ^ RosAsm project on WebArchive.org. ^ Part of the C++Builder Tool Chain, but not sold as a stand-alone product, or marketed since the CodeGear spin-off; Borland was still selling it until then. Version 5.0, the last, is dated 1996. ^ Turbo Assembler was developed as "Turbo Editasm" by Uriah Barnett from Speedware Inc (Sacramento, CA) between 1984 and 1987. It was later sold to (or marketed by) Borland as their Turbo Assembler.
