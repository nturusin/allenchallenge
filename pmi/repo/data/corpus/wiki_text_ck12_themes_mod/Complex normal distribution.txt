In probability theory, the family of complex normal distributions characterizes complex random variables whose real and imaginary parts are jointly normal. The complex normal family has three parameters: location parameter , covariance matrix , and the relation matrix C. The standard complex normal is the univariate distribution with = 0, = 1, and C = 0. An important subclass of complex normal family is called the circularly-symmetric complex normal and corresponds to the case of zero relation matrix and zero mean: . Circular symmetric complex normal random variables are used extensively in signal processing, and are sometimes referred to as just complex normal in signal processing literature. Suppose X and Y are random vectors in Rk such that vec[X Y] is a 2k-dimensional normal random vector. Then we say that the complex random vector has the complex normal distribution. This distribution can be described with 3 parameters: where Z denotes matrix transpose, and Z denotes complex conjugate. Here the location parameter can be an arbitrary k-dimensional complex vector; the covariance matrix must be Hermitian and non-negative definite; the relation matrix C should be symmetric. Moreover, matrices and C are such that the matrix is also non-negative definite. Matrices and C can be related to the covariance matrices of X and Y via expressions and conversely The probability density function for complex normal distribution can be computed as where R = C 1 and P = RC. The characteristic function of complex normal distribution is given by where the argument is a k-dimensional complex vector. If Z is a complex normal k-vector, A an k matrix, and b a constant -vector, then the linear transform AZ + b will be distributed also complex-normally: If Z is a complex normal k-vector, then Central limit theorem. If z1, , zT are independent and identically distributed complex random variables, then where = E[zz] and C = E[zz]. The circularly-symmetric and zero mean complex normal distribution corresponds to the case of zero mean and zero relation matrix, =0, C=0. If Z = X + iY is circularly-symmetric complex normal, then the vector vec[X Y] is multivariate normal with covariance structure where = E[Z] = 0 and = E[ZZ]. This is usually denoted and its distribution can also be simplified as Therefore, if the non-zero mean and covariance matrix are unknown, a suitable log likelihood function for a single observation vector would be The standard complex normal corresponds to the distribution of a scalar random variable with = 0, C = 0 and = 1. Thus, the standard complex normal distribution has density This expression demonstrates why the case C = 0, = 0 is called circularly-symmetric. The density function depends only on the magnitude of z but not on its argument. As such, the magnitude |z| of standard complex normal random variable will have the Rayleigh distribution and the squared magnitude |z|2 will have the Exponential distribution, whereas the argument will be distributed uniformly on [, ]. If {z1, , zn} are independent and identically distributed k-dimensional circular complex normal random variables with = 0, then random squared norm has the Generalized chi-squared distribution and the random matrix has the complex Wishart distribution with n degrees of freedom. This distribution can be described by density function where n k, and w is a kk nonnegative-definite matrix.
