Ernst Kretschmer (October 8, 1888 February 8, 1964), was a German psychiatrist who researched the human constitution and established a typology. Kretschmer was born in Wstenrot near Heilbronn. He attended Cannstatt Hochschule, one of the oldest Latin schools in Stuttgart. From 1906 to 1912 he studied theology, medicine, and philosophy at the universities of Tbingen, Munich and Hamburg. From 1913 he was assistant of Robert Gaupp in Tbingen, where he received his habilitation in 1918. He continued as assistant medical director until 1926. Kretschmer was the first to describe the persistent vegetative state which has also been called Kretschmer's syndrome. Another medical term coined after him is Kretschmers sensitive paranoia. [1] This classification has the merit of singling out "a type of paranoia that was unknown" prior to Kretschmer, and which "does not resemble the stereotypical image [...] of sthenic paranoia". Furthermore, between 1915 and 1921 he developed a differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and manic depression. Kretschmer is also known for developing a classification system that can be seen as one of the earliest exponents of a constitutional (the total plan or philosophy on which something is constructed) approach. His classification system was based on three main body types: asthenic/leptosomic (thin, small, weak), athletic (muscular, largeboned), and pyknic (stocky, fat). (The athletic category was later combined into the category asthenic/leptosomic). Each of these body types was associated with certain personality traits and, in a more extreme form, psychopathologies. Kretschmer believed that pyknic persons were friendly, interpersonally dependent, and gregarious. In a more extreme version of these traits, this would mean for example that the obese are predisposed toward manic-depressive illness. Thin types were associated with introversion and timidity. This was seen as a milder form of the negative symptoms exhibited by withdrawn schizophrenics. However, the idea of the association of body types with personality traits is no longer influential in personality theory. In 1926 he became the director of the psychiatric clinic at Marburg University. Kretschmer was a founding member of the AGP (General medical society for psychotherapy) which was founded on January 12, 1927. He was the president of AGP from 1929. In 1933 he resigned from the AGP for political reasons, but started to support the SS and signed the "Vow of allegiance of the professors of the German universities and high-schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic state." He did not oppose the eugenic laws of Nazi Germany. From 1946 until 1959, Kretschmer was the director of the psychiatric clinic of the University of Tbingen. He died, aged 75, in Tbingen. Kretschmer divided personality into two "constitutional groups": Schizothymic, which contain a "Psychaesthetic proportion" between sensitive and cold poles, and Cyclothymic which contain a "Diathetic" proportion between gay and sad. The Schizoids consist of the Hyperesthetic (sensitive) and Anesthetic (Cold) characters, and the Cycloids consist of the Depressive (or "melancholic") and Hypomanic characters.
