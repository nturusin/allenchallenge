Zorocratidae is a family of uncommon, somewhat wolf spider-like, wandering spiders. The eye arrangement is not like that of wolf spiders as the posterior eyes are not enlarged and the eyes are in two rows. Little is known of their biology, but they include about 20 species in 5 genera found primarily in Africa, Madagascar, and North America. The North American species all belong to the genus Zorocrates. The genus Uduba is known only from Madagascar. The odd distribution seems to indicate a connection with continental drift and the family was apparently broken up with the final separation of Africa and the Americas. Twenty new Zorocrates species were described from Mexico and Texas in 2007 (Platnick & Ubick, 2007).
