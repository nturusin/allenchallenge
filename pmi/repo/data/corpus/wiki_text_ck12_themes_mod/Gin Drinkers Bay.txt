Gin Drinkers Bay (Chinese: , literally Drunkard's Bay) or Gin Drinker's Bay is also known as Lap Sap Wan (, lit. Rubbish Bay, Cantonese Jyutping: laap6 saap3 waan1). It was a bay in Kwai Chung, Hong Kong. The bay was reclaimed in 1960s and became Kwai Fong and part of Kwai Hing. At the mouth of the bay stood the island of Tsing Chau. The bay was a harbour for Tanka fishing junks. They relocated to Tsing Yi Tong and Mun Tsai Tong of Tsing Yi Island before the commencement of reclamation. Lap Sap () means "rubbish" in Cantonese. It is unclear that why the bay was named 'rubbish' in the past. However, coincidentally it was once a dumping area for rubbish after extensive reclamation. It is assumed that in Gin Drinkers Bay Park or Kwai Chung Park near Tsing Chau that the area is subject to landfill gas produced deep in the ground even though it is covered with hills of earth. It remains closed due to unsafe levels of landfill gas. Gin Drinkers Bay is known for the Gin Drinkers Line, which formed a defensive line against the Japanese invasion in 1941.
