In statistics, an adaptive estimator is an estimator in a parametric or semiparametric model with nuisance parameters such that the presence of these nuisance parameters does not affect efficiency of estimation. Formally, let parameter in a parametric model consists of two parts: the parameter of interest N Rk, and the nuisance parameter H Rm. Thus = (,) NH Rk+m. Then we will say that is an adaptive estimator of in the presence of if this estimator is regular, and efficient for each of the submodels Adaptive estimator estimates the parameter of interest equally well regardless whether the value of the nuisance parameter is known or not. The necessary condition for a regular parametric model to have an adaptive estimator is that where z and z are components of the score function corresponding to parameters and respectively, and thus I is the top-right km block of the Fisher information matrix I(). Suppose is the normal location-scale family: Then the usual estimator is adaptive: we can estimate the mean equally well whether we know the variance or not. I. V. Blagouchine and E.
