Corrasion is a geomorphological term for the process of mechanical erosion of the earth's surface caused when materials are transported across it by running water, waves, glaciers, wind or gravitational movement downslope. An example is the wearing away of rock on a river or seabed by the impact or grinding action of particles moving with the water. The resultant effect on the rock is called abrasion.
