Anguimorphs of the infraorder Anguimorpha include the anguids (alligator lizards, glass lizards, galliwasps and legless lizards). The infraorder was named by Frbringer in 1900 to include all autarchoglossans closer to Varanus and Anguis than Scincus. These lizards, along with iguanians and snakes, constitute the proposed "venom clade" Toxicofera of all venomous reptiles.
