The bigha (Hindi: , Assamese: , Bengali: ) is a unit of measurement of area of a land, commonly used in Nepal, Bangladesh and in a number of states of India, including Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Gujarat, Rajasthan etc. The precise size of a bigha appears to vary considerably. Sources have given measurements ranging from 1,500 to 6,771 square metres (16,150 to 72,880 sq ft), but in several smaller pockets, it can be as high as 12,400 square metres (133,000 sq ft). The bigha is a traditional unit of land in several parts of India, with land purchases still being undertaken in this unit. However, it varies in size from one part of India to another. It is usually less than one acre (0.4 hectares), but can extend up to 3 acres (1.2 hectares). Various states and often parts within states have different sizes attributed to the bigha. In Assam, a bigha is 14,400 square feet (1,340 m2), subdivided into five katha. Each katha consists of 20 lecha with a lecha covering 144 square feet (13.4 m2) in area, and hence each katha is 2,880 square feet (268 m2) in area, although this may vary. According to Department of land resources of India 1 Bigha(Assam) = 5 Katha or 20 Lessa or 14,400 Sq feet. This means 1 bigha equals 0.02675608 hectare or 0.06611571355 acre. In Bihar, different areas use different sizes to define the bigha. Near the capital, Patna, one katha is equivalent to 20 lecha, equating to 1,361 square feet (126.4 m2). One katha is further subdivided in 20 dhur, hence, each dhur is approximately 68.06 square feet (6.323 m2). One dhur is further subdivided in 20 dhurki, hence, each dhurki is approximately 3.403 square feet (0.3161 m2). Note that in some of eastern parts of the state including Munger, Bhagalpur and Jamui, one dhur is further subdivided into one square lagga (pole length). One lagga is equivalent to 5.5 hand lengths, with each hand length being 18 inches (460 mm). Therefore one lagga is 99 inches, or 251.46 cm. In Himachal Pradesh, five bigha is equal to one acre (0.0809 hectare). In Punjab, four bigha is equal to one acre. In central India, bighas were standardized at 3025 yd2((2529.3 m2) or 5/8 acre (0.2529 hectare). In Madhya Pradesh, one Katha = 600 square feet (56 m2). In Rajasthan, one bigha is equal to 1,618.7 square metres (17,424 sq ft). In Uttar Pradesh, one bigha can mean different things to people in different areas of the state. In the more developed western areas of the state one bigha is either equal to five biswa (one biswa is 125 square metres (1,350 sq ft) or 6.75 biswa. In the remainder of Uttar Pradesh, 1 bigha is divided into 20 biswas. Each Biswas is 125 m2 or 154.32 yd2 (hence one Bigha is 0.25 Hectare (or 2500 m2 or 301 yd2(). 7 Bisa ~ 1 Bigha (Kaccha)(In Western UP)IN u.p 1 acres = 2 biga In Uttar Pradesh (West) the measurements are slightly different: one Bigha=20 20 bishwa=60 Decimal=2428.80 m2 In Uttarakhand, 1 Bigha is subdivided into 19 Bissas or 12 Nali. In Imperial and SI Units, each Bigha is 968 yd2 or 800 m2. In West Bengal, the Bigha was standardized under British colonial rule at 1600 yd2 (0.1338 hectare or 0.3306 acre); this is often interpreted as being 1/3 acre (it is precisely 40121 acre). In metric units, a bigha is hence 1333 m2. Bigha is a traditional unit of land in all over Bangladesh, with land purchases still being undertaken in this unit. In terms of acre, 3 bighas is just 60.5 katha short of 1 acre. Measurements of area in terms of bigha 1 Katha () = 720 sq ft (66.89 sq m) 1 Bigha () = 20 katha () (14,400 sq ft or 1,337.8 sq m) 1 Acre () = 3 bigha () 60.5 katha () (4,840 sq yd or 43,560 sq ft) A Bigha is a customary unit of measurement in Nepal, equal to about 6,773 square meters. Officially, most measurement of lands use units of either Bigha (in Terai region) or Ropani (Nepali: ) (in Hilly regions). Metric system is very seldom used officially in measuring area of Land. Measurement of area in terms of bigha 1 Bigha ()= 20 Kattha () (about 6,772.63 m or 72900 sq.ft.) 1 Kattha () = 20 Dhur () (about 338.63 m or 3,645 sq.ft.) 1 Dhur () = 16.93 m or 182.25 sq.ft. 1 Kanwa () = 1/16 Dhur () 1 Kanaee () = 1/16 Kanwa () [Kanwa is largely obsolete and is used only when tiny lands are very precious] 1 Bigha = 13.31 Ropani () 1 Ropani = 16 aana () (about 508.72 m or 5476 sq. ft.) 1 aana = 4 paisa () (about 31.80 m or 342.25 sq.ft.) 1 paisa = 4 daam () (7.95 m) 1 Bigha = 6,772.63 m For the different Ropani system from the one above 1 Bigha = .677263 hectare = 1.6735 acre = 13.31 Ropani 1 Hectare = 19.6565 Ropani 19.6565 Ropani = 1 Hectare 1 Ropani = 508.83771 m The following measure of land existed in uttar pradesh: A Kattha (also spelled Cottah) is a unit of area approximately equal to 1/20th of a uttar pradesh (1361.25 ft or 126.46 m). A Kattha is approximately 1361.25 square foot or 1/20 of a Bigha. It is still in use in much of Bangladesh and India. 1 Kattha=3.125 decimal 1 decimal=435.6 sq ft/436 sq.ft 1 Kattah (or Cottah) = 1361.25 Sq ft 1 Kattah (or Cottah) = 126.46 Sq meter 20 Kattah (or Cottah) = 1 Bigha 1.6 Bigha = 1 Acre approx. (43560 sq feet) = 100 Decimal And related with Gonda measure of land in Noakhali, Bangladesh: 4 Kora = 1 Gonda 20 Gonda = 1 Kani 80 Kora = 1 Kani 120 Decimal = 1 Kani In Fiji Hindi 1 bigha is equal to 1 acre
