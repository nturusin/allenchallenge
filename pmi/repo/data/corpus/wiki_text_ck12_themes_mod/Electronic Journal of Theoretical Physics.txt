The Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics is a quarterly peer-reviewed open access scientific journal that was established in 2003. It covers all aspects of theoretical physics. The editors-in-chief are Ammar Sakaji (International Institute for Theoretical Physics and Mathematics, Prato, Italy) and Ignazio Licata (Institute for Scientific Methodology, Palermo, Italy) and the printed version is published by Aracne Editrice. The journal is abstracted and indexed in Scopus. The journal annually awards the Majorana Prize, also known as the Majorana Medal, to recognize outstanding contributions to theoretical and mathematical physics. The prize is named for Italian physicist Ettore Majorana (19061938), a pioneer in neutrino physics and the quantum mechanics of spin. It is awarded in three categories: The Best Person in Physics The Best EJTP Special Issue Paper The Best EJTP Paper
