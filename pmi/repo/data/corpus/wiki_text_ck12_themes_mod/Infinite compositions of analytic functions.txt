In mathematics, infinite compositions of analytic functions (ICAF) offer alternative formulations of continued fractions, series, products and other infinite expansions, and the theory evolving from such compositions may shed light on the convergence/divergence of these expansions. Some functions can actually be expanded directly as infinite compositions. In addition, it is possible to use ICAF to evaluate solutions of fixed point equations involving infinite expansions. Complex dynamics offers another venue for iteration of systems of functions rather than a single function. For infinite compositions of a single function see Iterated function. For compositions of a finite number of functions, useful in fractal theory, see Iterated function system. There are several notations describing infinite compositions, including the following: Forward compositions: Fk,n(z) = fk fk+1 ... fn1 fn. Backward compositions: Gk,n(z) = fn fn1 ... fk+1 fk In each case convergence is interpreted as the existence of the following limits: For convenience, set Fn(z) = F1,n(z) and Gn(z) = G1,n(z). Many results can be considered extensions of the following result: Contraction Theorem for Analytic Functions. Let f be analytic in a simply-connected region S and continuous on the closure S of S. Suppose f(S) is a bounded set contained in S. Then for all z in S where is the attractive fixed point of f in S. Let {fn} be a sequence of functions analytic on a simply-connected domain S. Suppose there exists a compact set S such that for each n, fn(S) . Forward (inner or right) Compositions Theorem. {Fn(z)} converges uniformly on compact subsets of S to a constant function F(z) = . Backward (outer or left) Compositions Theorem. {Gn(z)} converges uniformly on compact subsets of S to if and only if the sequence of fixed points {n} of the {fn} converge to . Additional theory resulting from investigations based on these two theorems, particularly Forward Compositions Theorem, include location analysis for the limits obtained here [1]. For a different approach to Backward Compositions Theorem, see [2]. Regarding Backward Compositions Theorem, the example f2n(z) = 1/2 and f2n1(z) = 1/2 for S = {z : |z| < 1} demonstrates the inadequacy of simply requiring contraction into a compact subset, like Forward Compositions Theorem. Results involving entire functions include the following, as examples. Set Then the following results hold: Theorem E1. If an 1, then Fn F, entire. Theorem E2. Set n = |an1| suppose there exists non-negative n, M1, M2, R such that the following holds: Then Gn(z) G(z), analytic for |z| < R. Convergence is uniform on compact subsets of {z : |z| < R}. Theorem GF3. Let {fn} be a sequence of complex functions defined on S = {z : |z| < M}. Suppose there exists a non-negative sequence {n} such that Set . Then Gn(z) G(z) for |z| < R, uniformly on compact subsets. Theorem GF4. Let fn(z) = z(1+gn(z)), analytic for |z| < R0, with |gn(z)| Cn, Choose 0 < r < R0 and define Then Fn F uniformly for |z| R. Furthermore, . Results for compositions of linear fractional (Mbius) transformations include the following, as examples: Theorem LFT1. On the set of convergence of a sequence {Fn} of non-singular LFTs, the limit function is either (a) a non-singular LFT, (b) a function taking on two distinct values, or (c) a constant. In (a), the sequence converges everywhere in the extended plane. In (b), the sequence converges either everywhere, and to the same value everywhere except at one point, or it converges at only two points. Case (c) can occur with every possible set of convergence. Theorem LFT2. If {Fn} converges to an LFT , then fn converge to the identity function f(z) = z. Theorem LFT3. If fn f and all functions are hyperbolic or loxodromic Mbius transformations, then Fn(z) , a constant, for all , where {n} are the repulsive fixed points of the {fn}. Theorem LFT4. If fn f where f is parabolic with fixed point . Let the fixed-points of the {fn} be {n} and {n}. If then Fn(z) , a constant in the extended complex plane, for all z. The value of the infinite continued fraction may be expressed as the limit of the sequence {Fn(0)} where As a simple example, a well-known result (Worpitsky Circle*) follows from an application of Theorem (A): Consider the continued fraction with Stipulate that || < 1 and |z| < R < 1. Then for 0 < r < 1, , analytic for |z| < 1. Set R = 1/2. Examples illustrating the conversion of a function directly into a composition follow: Suppose that for |t| > 1, , an entire function with (0) = 0, (0) = 1. Then . Example. By a similar procedure, Example. And by inverting the composition, Example. [3] Theorem (B) can be applied to determine the fixed-points of functions defined by infinite expansions or certain integrals. The following examples illustrate the process: Example (FP1): For || 1 let To find = G(), first we define: Then calculate with = 1, which gives: = 0.087118118... to ten decimal places after ten iterations. Theorem (FP2). Let (, t) be analytic in S = {z : |z| < R} for all t in [0, 1] and continuous in t. Set If |(, t)| r < R for S and t [0, 1], then has a unique solution, in S, with . Consider a time interval, normalized to I = [0, 1]. ICAFs can be constructed to describe continuous motion of a point, z, over the interval, but in such a way that at each "instant" the motion is virtually zero (see Zeno's Arrow): For the interval divided into n equal subintervals, 1 k n set analytic or simply continuous - in a domain S, such that for all k and all z in S, and . = Now, set and . If exists, the initial point z has moved to a new position, T(z), in a fashion described above (for large values of n, ). It is not difficult to show that f(z) = z + , 0 implies . A byproduct of this derivation is the following representation: And of course, if f(z) c, then = with f(z) := z + (z). Next, set , and Tn(z) = Tn,n(z). Let when that limit exists. The sequence {Tn(z)} defines contours = (cn, z) that follow the flow of the vector field f(z). If there exists an attractive fixed point , meaning |f(z)| |z| for 0 < 1, then Tn(z) T(z) along = (cn, z), provided (for example) . If cn c > 0, then Tn(z) T(z), a point on the contour = (c, z). It is easily seen that and when these limits exist. These concepts are marginally related to active contour theory in image processing, and are simple generalizations of the Euler method = The series defined recursively by fn(z) = z + gn(z) have the property that the nth term is predicated on the sum of the first n1 terms. In order to employ theorem (GF3) it is necessary to show boundedness in the following sense: If each fn is defined for |z| < M then |Gn(z)| < M must follow before |fn(z)z| = |gn(z)| Cn is defined for iterative purposes. This is because occurs throughout the expansion. The restriction serves this purpose. Then Gn(z) G(z) uniformly on the restricted domain. Example (S1): Set and M = 2. Then R = 2(/6) > 0. Then, if , z in S implies |Gn(z)| < M and theorem (GF3) applies, so that converges absolutely, hence is convergent. = The product defined recursively by , |z| M, have the appearance In order to apply theorem (GF3) it is required that where Once again, a boundedness condition must support If one knows Cn in advance, setting |z| R = M/P where suffices. Then Gn(z) G(z) uniformly on the restricted domain. Example (P1): Suppose that where , observing after a few preliminary computations, that |z| 1/4 implies |Gn(z)| < 0.27. Then and converges uniformly.
