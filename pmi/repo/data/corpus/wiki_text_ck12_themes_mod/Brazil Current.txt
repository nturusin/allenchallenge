The Brazil Current is a warm water current that flows south along the Brazilian south coast to the mouth of the Ro de la Plata. This current is caused by diversion of a portion of the Atlantic South Equatorial Current from where that current meets the South American continent. It is a western boundary current like the Gulf Stream, and is indeed its southern counterpart; however, it is considerably shallower and weaker. It flows south from the equator to the west wind drift. It joins the Falkland Current at the Argentine Sea (see BrazilFalkland Confluence), making it a temperate sea.
