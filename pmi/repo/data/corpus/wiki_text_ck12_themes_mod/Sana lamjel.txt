Sana lamjel was a customary unit of length used in the erstwhile kingdom of Manipur, now a state of India. The unit of length, defined by the ruler of the kingdom, Nongda Lairen Pakhangpa in 33 CE, being equal to the distance from the floor to the tips of the fingers of his raised right hand while standing (a fathom), plus 4 fingerwidths. The unit became a standard for land measurement. An area of 5060 sana lamjel was equal to 1 pari. 1 pari was 2 lourak, 4 sangam, 8 loukhai, 16 loushal, or 32 tong. The value was later redefined by King Khagemba (15971652) to be defined by distance between the fingertips of that his outstretched arms, plus 4 fingerwidths. After metrication in India in the mid-20th century, the unit became obsolete.
