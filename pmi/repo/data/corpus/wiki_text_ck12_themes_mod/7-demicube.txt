In geometry, a demihepteract or 7-demicube is a uniform 7-polytope, constructed from the 7-hypercube (hepteract) with alternated vertices truncated. It is part of a dimensionally infinite family of uniform polytopes called demihypercubes. Coxeter named this polytope as 141 from its Coxeter diagram, with a ring on one of the 1-length branches, . Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a demihepteract centered at the origin are alternate halves of the hepteract: (1,1,1,1,1,1,1) with an odd number of plus signs. There are 95 uniform polytopes with D6 symmetry, 63 are shared by the B6 symmetry, and 32 are unique:
