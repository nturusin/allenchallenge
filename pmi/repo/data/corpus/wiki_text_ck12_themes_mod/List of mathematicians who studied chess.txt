Chess and mathematics have been pursued intellectually for centuries by many researchers and scientists, especially mathematicians. Naturally, the logic and symmetry in chess appeal to mathematicians. The following mathematicians either played or studied chess in their life: George Airy (July 27, 1801 January 2, 1892) Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander (19 April 1909 15 February 1974) Adolf Anderssen (July 6, 1818 March 13, 1879) Henry Ernest Atkins (20 August 1872 31 January 1955) George Atwood (October, 1746 July 11, 1807) Charles Babbage (26 December 1791 18 October 1871) Walter William Rouse Ball (August 14, 1850 April 4, 1925) Harry Bateman (May 29, 1882 January 21, 1946) Max Black (February 24, 1909 August 27, 1988) Ludwig Bledow (July 27, 1795, Berlin August 6, 1846) Richard Borcherds (b.
