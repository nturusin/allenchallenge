The zebibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. It is a member of the set of units with binary prefixes defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Its unit symbol is ZiB. The prefix zebi (symbol Zi) represents multiplication by 10247, therefore: 1 zebibyte = 270 bytes = 1180591620717411303424bytes = 1024 exbibytes The prefix zebi was originally not part of the system of binary prefixes, but was added together with the prefix yobi by the IEC in August 2005. GUID Partition Table (GPT) allows for a maximum disk and partition size of 8 zebibytes, or 9.4 zettabytes, when using 512-byte sectors.
