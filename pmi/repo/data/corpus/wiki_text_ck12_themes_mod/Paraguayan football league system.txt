The Paraguayan football league system is a series of interconnected leagues for football clubs in Paraguay. At the top is the Primera Divisin or Divisin de Honor(first division) with 12 clubs. Below the 1st level is the Intermedia (second division). In order to get promoted to the Intermedia there are two subdivisions at the 3rd level: the Primera Divisin B Metropolitana, which comprises teams from the Gran Asuncin area; and the Primera Divisin B Nacional which contains the best teams from the different Departments of Paraguay. The 4th level is similar, with the Primera Divisin C containing only teams from the Gran Asuncin area. The other subdivision is comprised by all 17 federations from each Paraguayan Department (governed by the UFI), which in turn, contain several regional leagues that cover the whole country.
