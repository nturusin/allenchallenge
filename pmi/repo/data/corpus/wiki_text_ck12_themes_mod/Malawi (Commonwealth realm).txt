The Commonwealth realm of Malawi, known officially as 'Malawi', was a predecessor to the modern-day Republic of Malawi. It existed between 1964 and 1966. When British rule ended in 1964, by the Malawi Independence Act 1964, the Nyasaland Protectorate, formerly a constituent of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, was given independence as a Commonwealth realm with the British monarch as head of state. Malawi shared the Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II, with the other Commonwealth realms. The monarch's constitutional roles were mostly delegated to the Governor-General of Malawi: Sir Glyn Smallwood Jones (6 July 1964 - 6 July 1966) The royal succession was governed by the English Act of Settlement of 1701. Elizabeth II did not reside in or visit Malawi in the 1960s but she did visit in 1979 (2225 July) as Head of the Commonwealth. Hastings Banda held office as prime minister (and head of government) of Malawi during this period. Following the abolition of the monarchy, the Republic of Malawi came into existence on 6 July 1966 and Banda became the first President of Malawi.
