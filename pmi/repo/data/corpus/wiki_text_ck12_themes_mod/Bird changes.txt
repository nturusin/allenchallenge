The Blues for Alice changes, Bird changes, Bird Blues, or New York Blues changes, is a chord progression, often named after Charlie Parker ("Bird"), which is a variation of the twelve-bar blues. The progression uses a series of sequential II-V or secondary II-V progressions, and has been used in pieces such as Parker's "Blues for Alice". Toots Thielemans's "Bluesette" and Parker's "Confirmation" also have similar progressions. A simple blues progression, in C, is as follows: | C | C | C | C | | F | F | C | C | | G | F | C | C || A typical blues progression in jazz, in C, is as follows: | C7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | | F7 | F7 | C7 | Em7 A7 | | Dm7 | G7 | C7 A7 | D7 G7 || The Bird Blues progression, in C, is as follows: Popular music symbols | CMaj7 | Bm7b5 / E7 | Am7 / D7 | Gm7 / C7 | | F7 | Fm7 / Bb7 | Em7 / A7 | Ebm7 / Ab7 | | Dm7 | G7 | CMaj7 / A7 | Dm7 / G7 || Roman numerals | I | vii / III7 | vi / II7 | v / I7 | | IV7 | iv / bVII7 | iii / VI7 | biii / bVI7 | | ii | V7 | I / VI7 | ii / V || This can be viewed as a cycle of ii-V progressions leading to the IV chord (F7 in the key of C major), and the tritone substitution of the dominant chords leading by half-step to the V chord (G7 again in C).
