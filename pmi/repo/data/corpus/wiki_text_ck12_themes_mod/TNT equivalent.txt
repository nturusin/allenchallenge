TNT equivalent is a method of quantifying the energy released in explosions. The "ton of TNT" is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 gigajoules, which is approximately the amount of energy released in the detonation of a metric ton (1,000 kilograms or 1 megagram) of TNT. The "megaton of TNT" is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 petajoules. The kiloton and megaton of TNT have traditionally been used to rate the energy output, and hence destructive power, of nuclear weapons (see nuclear weapon yield) and other high-energy events. This unit is written into various nuclear weapon control treaties, and gives a sense of destructiveness as compared with ordinary explosives, like TNT. More recently, it has been used to describe the energy released in other highly destructive events, such as asteroid impacts. However, TNT is not the most energetic of conventional explosives. Dynamite, for example, has about 60% more energy density (approximately 7.5 MJ/kg, compared to about 4.7 MJ/kg for TNT). This use of the unit named "ton" (along with the usual metric prefixes) is now one of energy, and any relationship with some mass of some explosive is relevant only in a historical sense. The use of "kilotonne" is therefore nonsensical, as this use of the term "ton" has been disconnected from its use as a unit of weight. A gram of TNT releases 26736702 joules upon explosion. To define the ton of TNT, this was arbitrarily standardized by letting 1 gram TNT = 4184 J (exactly). This conveniently defined the energy liberated by one gram of TNT as exactly one kilocalorie. This definition is a conventional one. The explosive's energy is normally calculated using the thermodynamic work energy of detonation, which for TNT has been accurately measured at 4686 J/g from large numbers of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853 J/g. The measured pure heat output of a gram of TNT is only 2724 J, but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculations. Alternative TNT equivalency can be calculated depending upon when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared. A kiloton of TNT can be visualized as a cube of TNT 8.46 metres (27.8 ft) on a side. 1 ton TNT equivalent is approximately: 1.0109 calories 4.184109 joules 3.96831106 British thermal units 3.08802109 foot pounds 1.162103 kilowatt hours For more, see Orders of magnitude (energy).
