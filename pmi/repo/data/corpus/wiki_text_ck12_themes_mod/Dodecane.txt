Dodecane (also known as dihexyl, bihexyl, adakane 12 or duodecane) is a liquid alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)10CH3 (or C12H26), an oily liquid of the paraffin series. It has 355 isomers. It is used as a solvent, distillation chaser, and scintillator component. It is used as a diluent for tributyl phosphate (TBP) in reprocessing plants. The combustion reaction of dodecane is as follows: C12H26(l) + 18.5 O2(g) 12 CO2(g) + 13 H2O(g) H = 7513 kJ One litre of fuel needs about 15 kg of air to burn, and generates 2.3 kg (or 1.2 m3) of CO2 upon complete combustion. In recent years, n-dodecane has garnered attention as a possible surrogate for kerosene-based fuels such as Jet-A, S-8, and other conventional aviation fuels. It is considered a second-generation fuel surrogate designed to emulate the laminar flame speed, largely supplanting n-decane, primarily due to its higher molecular mass and lower hydrogen to carbon ratio which better reflect the n-alkane content of jet fuels.
