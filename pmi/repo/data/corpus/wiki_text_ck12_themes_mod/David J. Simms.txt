David J. Simms is a Fellow Emeritus and former Associate Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin specialized in differential geometry and geometric quantisation. David Simms has been a member of the Royal Irish Academy since 1978 and is a member of the Editorial Board of the journal Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Simms completed his undergraduate degree in Mathematics in Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1955. He was elected a Scholar of the College in 1952, when he was just in the first year of his degree, a notable achievement. He went on to do a Ph.D. in the University of Cambridge under W.V.D.Hodge. Simms lectured in Glasgow University before returning to Trinity. Simms' research interests include differential geometry and geometric quantisation.
