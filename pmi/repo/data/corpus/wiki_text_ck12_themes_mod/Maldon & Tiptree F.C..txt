Maldon & Tiptree Football Club is an English football club based in Maldon, Essex. The club are currently members of Division One North of the Isthmian League and play at the Wallace Binder Ground. Maldon Town were formed in August 1946 as part of the Maldon Social and Athletic Club. They joined Division Two of the Chelmsford & Mid-Essex League. The following season they played in the North Essex League before returning to the Chelmsford & Mid Essex League in 1949. They won the Premier Division in 194950 and 195051 and then joined the Premier Division of the Essex & Suffolk Border League. They won the league cup in 196465 and the Premier Division the following season, after which they joined the Eastern Counties League. In 197172 the club finished second from bottom in the ECL and rather than go through the re-election process, resigned and joined the Essex Senior League. They won the ESL in 198485 and returned to the ECL in 1996 when they joined Division One. In 199798 they finished second and were promoted to the Premier Division. In 200304 they finished second to AFC Sudbury and were promoted to Division One East of the Southern League. They finished third in their first season and defeated Uxbridge on penalties in the play-off final, earning promotion to level seven of the football pyramid, and were placed in the Premier Division of the Isthmian League. However, they were relegated at the end of the season. In 200607 they finished fourth in the division, but were barred from taking part in the play-offs due to ground grading issues. In September 2009 the club was taken over by nearby Tiptree United chairman Ed Garty, with Tiptree moving to Maldon's Wallace Binder ground. In 2010 Tiptree withdrew from the Essex Senior League and were amalgamated into Maldon Town to form Maldon & Tiptree. Maldon Town originally played at the Sadd's Ground on the Causeway. In 1947 they moved to the Promenade, where they spent three seasons before moving to a ground on Fambridge Road that was named for Wallace Binder, who had financed the move. In 1994 they moved to a new ground on Park Drive, which was also named the Wallace Binder ground. The record attendance at the new ground was set in 2003 when 1,163 watched the FA Vase semi-final against AFC Sudbury.
