This is a list of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Gymnastics champions, by division and year. All schools currently compete in one division, because only 16 schools sponsor men's gymnastics teams. Only one of the 16 teams is not in Division I: Springfield College (Division III). The 16 teams are divided into two regions. The East Region has eleven teams: Illinois (Big Ten), Illinois-Chicago (Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastics League), Iowa (Big Ten), Michigan (Big Ten), Minnesota-Twin Cities (Big Ten), Ohio State (Big Ten), Penn State (Big Ten), Springfield (EIGL), U.S. Military Academy (EIGL), U.S. Naval Academy (EIGL), and William and Mary (EIGL). The West Region has five teams: California, Berkeley (Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), Nebraska-Lincoln (Big Ten), Oklahoma (MPSF), Stanford (MPSF), and U.S. Air Force Academy (MPSF).
