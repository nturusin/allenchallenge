In philosophy of science, the empirical limits of science define problems with observation, and thus are limits of human ability to inquire and answer questions about phenomena. These include topics such as infinity, the future and god. In the 20th century several of these were well-documented or proposed in physics: The Planck length - actually a limit on distance itself. The Schrdinger's cat paradox. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The theorized event horizon of a black hole in special relativity. The cosmological horizon of the observable universe.
