Lost in the Stratosphere is a 1934 American film directed by Melville W. Brown and starring William Cagney, the lookalike brother of James Cagney. Two U.S. Army pilots, in the early days of military aviation, in the mid-1930s, in an era of open cockpits and biplanes, are always trying to do each other, in a friendly rivalry. William Cagney (James Cagney's lookalike brother, in one of his few roles in front of the cameras), as 2nd Lt. Tom Cooper, gets the nickname "Soapy", from his friend, 1st Lt. Richard "Dick" Wood, "Woody". Tom finds out that "Ida Johnson", the girl he's been seeing, while Dick's been off the base, is really Evelyn Worthington, June Collyer, Dick's fiance, who introduced herself, using her maid's name, played by Hattie McDaniel, as a lark (joke). But, it's no joke, when Dick finds the tell-tale bar of soap. The two pilots are picked to go on a dangerous mission into the stratosphere, with a balloon, to test high altitude flight; but, the friendship, and the engagement are off, before they get off the ground. The Generals keep reminding them that the equipment is more important than they are. It doesn't look like either of them will survive; until, Evelyn begs them, to save the love of her life and his friend, by ordering them to bail out. Unfortunately, the two are "lost in the stratosphere", when a thunderstorm takes them thousands of miles off course. William Cagney Lt. Tom 'Soapy' Cooper Edward J. Nugent as Lt.
