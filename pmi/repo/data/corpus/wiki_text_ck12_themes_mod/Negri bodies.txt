Negri bodies are eosinophilic, sharply outlined, pathognomonic inclusion bodies (210 m in diameter) found in the cytoplasm of certain nerve cells containing the virus of rabies, especially in Ammon's horn of the hippocampus. They are also often found in the cerebellar cortex of postmortem brain samples of rabies victims. They consist of ribonuclear proteins produced by the virus. They are named for Adelchi Negri.
