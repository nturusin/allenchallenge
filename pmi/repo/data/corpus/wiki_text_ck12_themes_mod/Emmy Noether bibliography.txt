Emmy Noether was a German mathematician. This article lists the publications upon which her reputation is built (in part). In the second epoch, Noether turned her attention to the theory of rings. With her paper Moduln in nichtkommutativen Bereichen, insbesondere aus Differential- und Differenzenausdrcken, Hermann Weyl states, "It is here for the first time that the Emmy Noether appears whom we all know, and who changed the face of algebra by her work." In the third epoch, Emmy Noether focused on non-commutative algebras, and unified much earlier work on the representation theory of groups.
