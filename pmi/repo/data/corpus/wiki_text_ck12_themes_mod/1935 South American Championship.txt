The thirteenth edition of the South American Championship was held in Lima, Peru from January 6 to 27, 1935. After the 1930 FIFA World Cup, in which Uruguay defeated Argentina 4-2 in the final match, the Argentine team broke football relations with their Uruguayan counterparts, claiming to have been heavily pressured, and that there even were aggressions directed at them, before and during the match. Six years after the previous edition, it was decided to continue the tournament. The tournament itself did not have a trophy in dispute. This tournament also served as the qualifying tournament for the 1936 Summer Olympics that were to be held in Berlin, Germany. The participating countries were Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay withdrew from the tournament. Each team played three matches. Two points were awarded for a win, one point for a draw and no points for a loss. 4 goals Masantonio 3 goals Ciocca 2 goals 1 goal
