Lowell Wayne Beineke (born 1939) is a professor of graph theory at Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne. Beineke is known for his elegant characterization of line graphs (derived graph) in terms of the nine Forbidden graph characterization. Beineke has taught mathematics at Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne since 1965. He received a B.S. from Purdue University in 1961 and a M.S. from the University of Michigan in 1962 and a Ph.D., in 1965, his Ph.D. advisor was Frank Harary. Beineke holds the Jack W. Schrey chair of mathematical sciences. Beineke was recipient of the Amoco Foundation the Outstanding Teaching Award in 1978, and again in 1992. Selected topics in graph theory, LW Beineke, R. J.
