An AAA or triple-A battery is a standard size of dry cell battery commonly used in low drain portable electronic devices. A carbon-zinc battery in this size is designated by IEC as "R03", by ANSI C18.1 as "24", by old JIS standard as "UM 4", and by other manufacturer and national standard designations that vary depending on the cell chemistry. A triple-A battery is a single cell and measures 44.5 mm in length and 10.5 mm in diameter. The length includes the positive terminal button which is a minimum 0.8mm high and 3.8mm in diameter; the flat negative terminal has a minimum diameter of 4.3 mm. Alkaline AAA batteries weigh around 11.5 grams each, while lithium AAA Batteries weigh about 7.6 g. Rechargeable nickelmetal hydride (NiMH) AAA Batteries typically weigh 1415 g. AAA batteries are most often used in small electronic devices, such as TV remote controls, MP3 players and digital cameras. Devices that require the same voltage, but have a higher current draw, are often designed to use larger batteries such as the AA battery type. AA batteries have about three times the capacity of AAA batteries. With the increasing efficiency and miniaturization of modern electronics, many devices which previously were designed for AA batteries (remote controls, and cordless computer mice and keyboards, etc.) are being replaced by models that accept AAA Battery cells. As of 2007, AAA batteries accounted for 24% of alkaline primary battery sales in the United States. In Japan as of 2011, 28% of alkaline primary batteries sold were AAA. In Switzerland as of 2008, AAA batteries totaled 30% of primary battery sales and 32% of secondary battery sales.
