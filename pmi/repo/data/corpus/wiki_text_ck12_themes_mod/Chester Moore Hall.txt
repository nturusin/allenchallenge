Chester Moore Hall (9 December 1703, Leigh, Essex, England 17 March 1771, Sutton, Surrey) was a British lawyer and inventor who produced the first achromatic lenses in 1729 or 1733 (accounts differ). He used the achromatic lens to build the first refracting telescope free from chromatic aberration (colour distortion). It is believed he did most his work while standing on a stool. He lived at New Hall, Sutton. His name was also spelled Chester Moor Hall and Chester More Hall.
