In geometry, an octagram is an eight-sided star polygon. The name octagram combine a Greek numeral prefix, octa-, with the Greek suffix -gram. The -gram suffix derives from (gramm) meaning "line". In general, an octagram is any self-intersecting octagon (8-sided polygon). The regular octagram is labeled by the Schlfli symbol {8/3}, which means an 8-sided star, connected by every 3rd point. These variations have a lower dihedral, Dih4, symmetry: The symbol Rub el Hizb is a Unicode glyph at U+06DE. Deeper truncations of the square can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate star polygon forms with equal spaced vertices and two edge lengths. A truncated square is an octagon, t{4}={8}. A quasitruncated square, inverted as {4/3}, is an octagram, t{4/3}={8/3}. The uniform star polyhedron stellated truncated hexahedron, t'{4,3}=t{4/3,3} has octagram faces constructed from the cube in this way. There are two regular octagrammic star figures (compounds) of the form {8/k}, the first constructed as two squares {8/2}=2{4}, and second as four degenerate digons, {8/4}=4{2}. There are other isogonal and isotoxal compounds including rectanglar and rhombic forms. An octagonal star can be seen as a concave hexadecagon, with internal intersecting geometry erased. It can also be dissected by radial lines.
