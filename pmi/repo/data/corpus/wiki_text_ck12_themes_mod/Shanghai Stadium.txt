The Shanghai Stadium (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Shnghi Tychng) is a multi-purpose stadium in Shanghai, China. It is currently used mostly for football matches of Chinese Super League club Shanghai East Asia. The stadium was built in 1997 when the 8th National Games of the People's Republic of China was held in Shanghai. It can hold almost 57.000 sets. It is one of the thirty largest football stadiums in the world, and is the third largest stadium in China after the Guangdong Olympic Stadium and the Beijing National Stadium. It was used for football preliminaries at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Shanghai Stadium was also the venue for the Opening Ceremony of the 2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games. It is due to host the Supercoppa Italiana Final between Juventus and Lazio on August 8, 2015. Shanghai Stadium is close to Shanghai Indoor Stadium. Since the names of the two buildings differ by only a word in both Chinese and in English, many people have confused the two. This has been made worse by the opening of Shanghai Metro Line 4, in which the two are situated at adjacent stops. The Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel is located within the stadium. To reach Shanghai Stadium, take Shanghai Metro Line 4 to the Shanghai Stadium station. The stadium and Shanghai's skyline are used in the opening credits of the sport section on Euronews. On Aug. 30, YG Entertainment's YG Family 2014 World Tour: Power was showcased at the stadium with 35,000 audiences.
