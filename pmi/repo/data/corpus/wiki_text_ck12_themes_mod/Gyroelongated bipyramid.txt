In geometry, the gyroelongated bipyramids are an infinite set of polyhedra, constructed by elongating an n-gonal bipyramid by inserting an n-gonal antiprism between its congruent halves. Two members of the set can be deltahedra, that is, constructed entirely of equilateral triangles: the gyroelongated square bipyramid, a Johnson solid, and the icosahedron, a Platonic solid. The gyroelongated triangular bipyramid can be made with equilateral triangles, but is not a deltahedron because it has coplanar faces, i.e. is not strictly convex. With pairs of triangles merged into rhombi, it can be seen as a trigonal trapezohedron. The other members can be constructed with isosceles triangles.
