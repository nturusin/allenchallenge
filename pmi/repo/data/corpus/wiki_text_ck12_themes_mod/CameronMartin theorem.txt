In mathematics, the CameronMartin theorem or CameronMartin formula (named after Robert Horton Cameron and W. T. Martin) is a theorem of measure theory that describes how abstract Wiener measure changes under translation by certain elements of the CameronMartin Hilbert space. The standard Gaussian measure n on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn is not translation-invariant. (In fact, there is a unique translation invariant Radon measure up to scale by Haar's theorem: the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure, denoted here dx.) Instead, a measurable subset A has Gaussian measure Here refers to the standard Euclidean dot product in Rn. The Gaussian measure of the translation of A by a vector h Rn is So under translation through h, the Gaussian measure scales by the distribution function appearing in the last display: The measure that associates to the set A the number n(Ah) is the pushforward measure, denoted (Th)(n). Here Th : Rn Rn refers to the translation map: Th(x) = x + h.. The above calculation shows that the RadonNikodym derivative of the pushforward measure with respect to the original Gaussian measure is given by Abstract Wiener measure on a separable Banach space E, where i : H E is an abstract Wiener space, is also a "Gaussian measure" in a suitable sense. How does it change under translation? It turns out that a similar formula to the one above holds if we consider only translations by elements of the dense subspace i(H) E. Let i : H E be an abstract Wiener space with abstract Wiener measure : Borel(E) [0, 1]. For h H, define Th : E E by Th(x) = x + i(h). Then (Th)() is equivalent to with RadonNikodym derivative where denotes the PaleyWiener integral. The CameronMartin formula is valid only for translations by elements of the dense subspace i(H) E, called CameronMartin space, and not by arbitrary elements of E. If the CameronMartin formula did hold for arbitrary translations, it would contradict the following result: If E is a separable Banach space and is a locally finite Borel measure on E that is equivalent to its own push forward under any translation, then either E has finite dimension or is the trivial (zero) measure. (See quasi-invariant measure.) In fact, is quasi-invariant under translation by an element v if and only if v i(H). Vectors in i(H) are sometimes known as CameronMartin directions. The CameronMartin formula gives rise to an integration by parts formula on E: if F : E R has bounded Frchet derivative DF : E Lin(E; R) = E, integrating the CameronMartin formula with respect to Wiener measure on both sides gives for any t R. Formally differentiating with respect to t and evaluating at t = 0 gives the integration by parts formula Comparison with the divergence theorem of vector calculus suggests where Vh : E E is the constant "vector field" Vh(x) = i(h) for all x E. The wish to consider more general vector fields and to think of stochastic integrals as "divergences" leads to the study of stochastic processes and the Malliavin calculus, and, in particular, the ClarkOcone theorem and its associated integration by parts formula. Using CameronMartin theorem one may establish (See Liptser and Shiryayev 1977, p. 280) that for a q q symmetric non-negative definite matrix, H(t) whose elements Hj,k(t) are continuous and satisfy the condition it holds for a qdimensional Wiener process w(t) that where G(t) is a q q nonpositive definite matrix which is a unique solution of the matrix-valued Riccati differential equation
