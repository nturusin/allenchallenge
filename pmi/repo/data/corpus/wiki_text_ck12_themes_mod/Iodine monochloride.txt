Iodine monochloride is an interhalogen compound with the formula ICl. It is a red-brown compound that melts near room temperature. Because of the difference in the electronegativity of iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and behaves as a source of I+. Iodine monochloride is produced simply by combining the halogens in a 1:1 molar ratio, according to the equation I2 + Cl2 2 ICl When chlorine gas is passed through iodine crystals, one observes the brown vapor of iodine monochloride. Dark brown iodine monochloride liquid is collected. Excess chlorine converts iodine monochloride into iodine trichloride in a reversible reaction: ICl + Cl2 ICl3 ICl has two polymorphs; -ICl, which exists as black needles (red by transmitted light) with a melting point of 27.2 C, and -ICl, which exists as black platelets (red-brown by transmitted light) with a melting point 13.9 C. In the crystal structures of both polymorphs the molecules are arraigned in zig-zag chains. -ICl is monoclinic with the space group P21/c. ICl is a useful reagent in organic synthesis. It is used as a source of electrophilic iodine in the synthesis of certain aromatic iodides. It also cleaves C-Si bonds. ICl will also add to the double bond in alkenes to give chloro-iodo alkanes. RCH=CHR + ICl RCH(I)-CH(Cl)R When such reactions are conducted in the presence of sodium azide, the iodo-azide RCH(I)-CH(N3)R is obtained. Wijs solution, which is iodine monochloride dissolved in acetic acid, is used to determine the iodine value of a substance.
