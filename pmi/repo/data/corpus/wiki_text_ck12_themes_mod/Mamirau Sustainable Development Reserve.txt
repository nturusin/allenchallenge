The Mamirau Sustainable Development Reserve in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, near the city of Tef, is a 4,300-square-mile (11,000 km2) reserve near the village of Boca do Mamirau. It includes mostly Amazonian flooded forest and wetlands. Mamirau is recognised by the international Ramsar Convention, as a wetland of global importance, as well as part of a World Heritage Convention's natural site. It has been proposed that the Reserve should form part of a future UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in the Brazilian Amazon. At present, it is included in one of the Ecological Corridors to be implemented by the PPG-7 Program for the Protection of Brazilian Tropical Forests. The reserve is the legacy and life work of Brazilian scientist Jos Mrcio Ayres. Mamirau has a human population estimated in 6,306 individuals, including amazonian caboclo, Ticuna, Cambeba and Cocama ameridian groups. Mamirau hosts a large diversity of birds, with more than 400 species recorded, including toucans, harpy eagle, hoatzin, 15 species of parrots and, specially, aquatic birds. Two species of monkeys, the white uakari and the black squirrel monkey are endemic of this region, which is also home of other kinds of arboreal mammals such as howler monkeys, sloths, coati and collared anteaters. Land mammals are not that common as most of the territory is flooded during the wet season. During this season the pink dolphin can be found in the flooded forest. The most conspicuous of the numerous fish species are tambaqui, piranha and pirarucu. Mamirau is also a perfect place to spot the Amazon river dolphins, both boto and tucuxi.
