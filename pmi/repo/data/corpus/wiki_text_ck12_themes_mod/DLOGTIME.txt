In computational complexity theory, DLOGTIME is the complexity class of all computational problems solvable in a logarithmic amount of computation time on a deterministic Turing machine. It must be defined on a random-access Turing machine, since otherwise the input tape is longer than the range of cells that can be accessed by the machine. It is a very weak model of time complexity: no random-access Turing machine with a smaller deterministic time bound can access the whole input. DLOGTIME-uniformity is important in circuit complexity.
