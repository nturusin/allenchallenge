Area code 284 is the local telephone area code of the British Virgin Islands (BVI). The 284 area code was created during a split from the original (809) area code which was done around October 1997. When in the British Virgin Islands, the seven digits should be dialed alone. When calling to the British Virgin Islands from anywhere in the United States or Canada dial 1-284 + seven digit phone number. The 284 area code has been linked to a form of telephone fraud known as the "one ring scam". The person perpetuating the scam calls the victim via a robodialer or similar means, sometimes at odd hours of the night and then hangs up when the phone is answered, with the hope that the victim will be curious enough to call the number back. When the victim does this, an automatic $19.95 international call fee is charged to their account as well as $9.00/min thereafter. Similar scams have been linked to Grenada (area code 473), Antigua (area code 268), Jamaica (area code 876) and the Dominican Republic (area code 809).
