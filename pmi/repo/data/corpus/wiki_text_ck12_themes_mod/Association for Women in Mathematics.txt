The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) is a professional society whose mission is to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity for and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences. The AWM was founded in 1971 and incorporated in the state of Massachusetts. AWM has approximately 3000 members, including over 200 institutional members (colleges universities, institutes, and mathematical societies). It offers numerous programs and workshops to mentor women and girls in the mathematical sciences. Much of AWMs work is supported through federal grants. The Association was founded in 1971 as the Association of Women Mathematicians, but the name was changed almost immediately. As reported in "A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives", by Lenore Blum, "As Judy Green remembers (and Chandler Davis, early AWM friend, concurs): 'The formal idea of women getting together and forming a caucus was first made publicly at a MAG [Mathematics Action Group] meeting in 1971 ... in Atlantic City. Joanne Darken, then an instructor at Temple University and now at the Community College of Philadelphia, stood up at the meeting and suggested that the women present remain and form a caucus. I have been able to document six women who remained: me (I was a graduate student at Maryland at the time), Joanne Darken, Mary [W.] Gray (she was already at American University), Diane Laison (then an instructor at Temple), Gloria Olive (a Senior Lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand who was visiting the U.S. at the time) and Annie Selden...It's not absolutely clear what happened next, except that I've personally always thought that Mary was responsible for getting the whole thing organized ....'" Mary W. Gray was the early organizer, placing an advertisement in the February 1971 Notices of the AMS, and writing the first issue of the AWM Newsletter that May. Early goals of the Association focused on equal pay for equal work, as well as equal consideration for admission to graduate school and support while there; for faculty appointments at all levels; for promotion and for tenure; for administrative appointments; and for government grants, positions on review and advisory panels and positions in professional organizations. The AWM holds an annual meeting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings. The AWM sponsors three honorary lecture series. Noether Lectures - honor women who "have made fundamental and sustained contributions to the mathematical sciences". Presented in association with the American Mathematical Society, the lecture is given at the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings. Falconer Lectures - honor women who "have made distinguished contributions to the mathematical sciences or mathematics education. Presented in association with the Mathematical Association of America, the lecture is given at the annual MathFest. Kovalevsky Lectures - honor women who have "made distinguished contributions in applied or computational mathematics". Presented in association with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), the lecture is given at the SIAM Annual Meeting. The lecture series is named for the mathematician Sonia Kovalevsky. The AWM sponsors several awards and prizes. Alice T. Schafer Prize - given each year "to an undergraduate woman for excellence in mathematics". Louise Hay Award - given each year for "outstanding achievements of a woman in mathematics education". M. Gweneth Humphreys Award - given each year for "outstanding mentorship activities of a woman in the mathematical sciences". Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize - given each year to a woman recently tenured in mathematics. The prize funds a semester in residence at Cornell University without teaching obligations. Three recently created prizes for early-career women are also sponsored by the AWM. AWM-Birman Research Prize - given every other year beginning in 2015 for "exceptional research in topology/geometry". AWM-Microsoft Research Prize - given every other year beginning in 2014 for "exceptional research in algebra/number theory". AWM-Sadosky Research Prize - given every other year beginning in 2014 for "exceptional research in analysis". Mary W. Gray, 19711973 Alice T.
