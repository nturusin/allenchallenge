The median palatal cyst is a rare cyst that may occur anywhere along the median palatal raphe. It may produce a swelling because of infection, and is treated by excision, or surgical removal. Some investogators now believe that this cyst represents a more posterior presentation of a nasopalatine duct cyst, rather than a separate cystic degeneration of epithelial rests at the line of fusion of the palatine shelves.
