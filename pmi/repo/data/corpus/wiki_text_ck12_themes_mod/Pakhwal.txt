Pakhwal Rajgan or pakhwal khas is a village located in northern Jhelum district between Chawk daulat and Kaladev. It was founded in 963. Pakhwal is divided into two parts; the first part, situated near the famous river Jehlum is called officially tawakkul pur pakhwal, the second part is called Pakhwal Khaas situated slightly near to the main road. The location of both villages is near fertile soils due to the availability and easy access of water from the river. The main two tribes in Pakhwal are Chaudry [Jaat] and Rajgaan; both consider themselves to belong to high castes; although, Islamically, castes are only for recognition and identity not for superiority the most superior and greatest in the sight of Allah azzawajalla is the one who is better in terms of piety and TAQWA. Although there was a lot of competition historically, over generations due to the prevalence of Islamic knowledge and departure of Hindus and Sikhs after the independence, neither of the castes predominately consider themselves better than each other, but this only depends on a person's piety, humbleness and individual respect and esteem in society. However, amongst the elders this notion of caste superiority may still remain and is transferred through generations. Both castes of people are believed to live happily with good understanding although some tension may occur rarely not particularly over socially constructed caste system. 32 56 N, 73 44 E Map reference: Asia Area: total: 3.97 km2 land: 3.5 km2 water: 0.47 km2 Area - comparative: slightly larger than Monaco Land boundaries: total: 6 km border villages: Bela 2 km, Kiri 1.2 km, Pind Ratwal 2.4 km,Katrili 0.3 km,chitti 0.1 km Coastline: 1.83 km Climate: modified continental with mild winters, cool summers Mostly gently rolling uplands with broad, shallow valleys; uplands to slightly mountainous in the north; steep slopes.
