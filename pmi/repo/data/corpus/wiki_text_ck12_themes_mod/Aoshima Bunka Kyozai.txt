In 1969, it released "Apollo series" spacecraft models including 1/48 scale "Eagle 5" Apollo Lunar Module and 1/96 scale Apollo spacecraft. These models became a big hit. In 1971, it started to release the 1/700 scale "Water Line series" warship models along with other three Shizuoka-based model manufacturers, Tamiya, Hasegawa and Fujimi. In the 1970s, Aoshima succeeded in the original development of kids products such as "Gattai Robo" (coalescent robot) series. In this series, four individual vehicles could coalesce into one robot. In 1980, it started to release "Anime scale" realistic robot models such as Ideon as a countermeasure against megahit Gundam models of Bandai. Aoshima was re-established as "Aoshima Bunka Kyozai Co., Ltd." ( ) in 1986. It launched a new brand "Skynet" (finished toy brand) in 1997, and also launched a new brand "Miracle House" (diecast figure brand) in 1999. In 2002, with the bankruptcy of Japanese model manufacturer Imai Kagaku, Aoshima acquired the molds of sailing ships and sci-fi vehicles such as Thunderbirds machines. In 2005, Aoshima launched a new brand "DISM" (diecast car brand), and established "Aoshima Hong Kong, Ltd." (). Another new brand "FunnyKnights" (female statue figure brand) was launched in 2007. In 2008, Aoshima started to release "Itasha" (animation wrapping car) model kits and they gained a huge popularity. In 2010, Hayabusa (Space Craft Plastic Model Kit Series) made a big hit. 1/72 scale Fighter planes of WWII series Fifteen World War II era single engine airplanes and two twin engine airplanes were released in the 1960s. There were minor airplanes such as Reppu (Sam), Shiun (Norm), Seiran, Zuiun (Paul) and P-63 Kingcobra among them. These models were rereleased several times, and some of them were available until the mid 2000s. 1/72 scale True fighter planes of WWII series In 1996, new 1/72 scale airplane models were released.

Almost Japanese warships have finished renewal, and some new WWII warships and modern JMSDF ships were added in renewal series. However, as to the foreign warships, only German battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz have been renewed.

Aoshima's car model range (in the universally popular 1/24 scale) strikes a good chord with modellers, particularly because much of their product range focuses on Japanese domestic models - well known in the actual size - but not as models. 1/24 scale The Best car GT/Vintage series A main automobile line.
