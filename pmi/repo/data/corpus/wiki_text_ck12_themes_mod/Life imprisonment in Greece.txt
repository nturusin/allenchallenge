Life imprisonment is legal under the Greek penal code, and is the most severe punishment available under Greek law. It can be imposed for murder, treason, terrorism, aircraft hijacking, and aggravated hostage taking. Those sentenced to life imprisonment can become eligible for parole after serving 16 years. If the prisoner received more than one life sentence, they can become eligible for parole after serving 20 years. Parole is not mandatory, and if parole is rejected, the inmate can reapply every 2 years. There are an average of 25 life sentences per year. The President of Greece can pardon the inmate anytime. For those under the age of 18, the maximum sentence is 20 years' imprisonment.
