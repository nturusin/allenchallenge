The NCAA Women's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships are the annual collegiate track and field competitions for women athletes representing Division I institutions organised by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Athletes' performances in individual championships earn points for their institutions and the team with the most points receives the NCAA team title in track and field. A separate NCAA Division I men's competition is also held. These two events are separate from the NCAA Women's Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships and NCAA Men's Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships held during the winter. The first edition of the championship was held in 1982. The current team champions are the Oregon Ducks, and the most successful team, with 14 titles, are the LSU Lady Tigers. Title revoked due to positive drug tests. |
