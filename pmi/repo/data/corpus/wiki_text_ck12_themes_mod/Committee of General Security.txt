The Committee of General Security (French: Comit de sret gnrale) was a French parliamentary committee which acted as police agency during the French Revolution that, along with the Committee of Public Safety, oversaw the Reign of Terror. The Committee supervised the local police committees in charge of investigating reports of treason, and was one of the agencies with authority to refer suspects to the Revolutionary Tribunal with authority to execute by guillotine. The Committee of General Security was established as a committee of the National Convention in October 1792. It was designed to protect the Revolutionary Republic from its internal enemies. By 1794 the Committee became part of the opposition to Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety and elements were involved in the 9 Thermidor coup d'tat.
