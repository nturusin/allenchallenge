As of 2012, Wind power in Vermont consists of 109 megawatts (MW) of operational wind farms. Together these wind projects would meet the electrical needs of approximately 56,000 average Vermont households (approximately the size of Windsor County). The first megawatt turbine in the world was installed at Grandpa's Knob, in Vermont, in 1941. The 6 MW Searsburg Wind Farm has operated since 1997. The 550-kilowatt turbines provide enough electricity to meet the needs of 1,600 average Vermont households. Sheffield Wind Farm is a 40 MW wind farm operating in Sheffield owned by First Wind. The 63 MW Kingdom Community Wind Farm is operational on Lowell Mountains ridge in Lowell, owned by Green Mountain Power (GMP) and Vermont Electric Co-op (VEC). Costing $156 million, the 21-turbine project began construction in September 2011, with completion expected by the end of 2012. Georgia Mountain Community Wind Project is an 4-turbine, 10-megawatt wind project on Georgia Mountain in the towns of Georgia and Milton. It is owned by a Vermont family and the power is being sold to the Burlington Electric Department. It was completed in December 2012. The projects 4 wind turbines will provide enough electricity to meet the needs of 4,200 average Vermont households. The 30 MW Deerfield Wind Project is located in Searsburg and Readsboro, and will include 15 turbines and provide enough electricity to meet the needs of 13,000 average Vermont households. Approximately 250 jobs will be created during construction and 9 permanent jobs. The project is expected to contribute $10 million in state Education Fund revenues over its 20-year life. Several 100 kW wind turbines manufactured by a Vermont company have been installed or planned at locations in the state, including Heritage Aviation, Bolton Ski Area, Dynapower, Rock of Ages, Burke Mountain, and the Lake Champlain Ferry at South Hero. Smaller wind turbines for residential use are also located throughout Vermont.
