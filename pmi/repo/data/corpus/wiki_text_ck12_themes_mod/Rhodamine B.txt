Rhodamine B /rodmin/ is a chemical compound and a dye. It is often used as a tracer dye within water to determine the rate and direction of flow and transport. Rhodamine dyes fluoresce and can thus be detected easily and inexpensively with instruments called fluorometers. Rhodamine dyes are used extensively in biotechnology applications such as fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and ELISA. Rhodamine B is used in biology as a staining fluorescent dye, sometimes in combination with auramine O, as the auramine-rhodamine stain to demonstrate acid-fast organisms, notably Mycobacterium. Rhodamine B is tunable around 610 nm when used as a laser dye. Its luminescence quantum yield is 0.65 in basic ethanol, 0.49 in ethanol, 1.0, and 0.68 in 94% ethanol. The fluorescence yield is temperature dependent. The solubility of Rhodamine B in water is ~15 g/L. However, the solubility in acetic acid solution (30 vol.%) is ~400 g/L. Chlorinated tap water decomposes rhodamine B. Rhodamine B solutions are often absorbed in plastics therefore , it should be kept in glass. Rhodamine B is being tested for use as a biomarker in oral rabies vaccines for wildlife, such as raccoons, to identify animals that have eaten a vaccine bait. The rhodamine is incorporated into the animal's whiskers and teeth. It is also often mixed with herbicides to show where they have been used. Rhodamine B (BV10) is mixed with Quinacridone Magenta (PR122) to make the bright pink watercolor known as Opera Rose. Rhodamine is often used in colors illegally in order to obtain a graceful shade(Opera Rose) . In California, rhodamine B is suspected to be carcinogenic and thus products containing it must contain a warning on its label. In New Jersey, MSDS files state that there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animal, and no evidence at all in humans.
