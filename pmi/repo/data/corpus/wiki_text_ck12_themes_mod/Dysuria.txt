In medicine, specifically urology, dysuria refers to painful urination. Difficult urination is also sometimes, but rarely, described as dysuria. It is one of a constellation of irritative bladder symptoms, which includes urinary frequency and haematuria. This is typically described to be a burning or stinging sensation. It is most often a result of a urinary tract infection. It may also be due to an STD, bladder stones, bladder tumours, and virtually any condition of the prostate. It can also occur as a side effect of anticholinergic medication used for Parkinson's disease. Dysuria causes can be split into four categories. These include a large number of conditions which may or may not be included in this list.
