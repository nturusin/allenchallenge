This article lists divisions of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), including the Heer, Luftwaffe, and Kriegsmarine, active during World War II. Upgrades and reorganizations are shown only to identify the variant names for what is notionally a single unit; other upgrades and reorganizations are deferred to the individual articles. Due to the scope of this list pre-war changes are not shown, nor are upgrades from units smaller than a division. Most of these divisions trained in Berlin which is also where new military technology was kept and tested. Grenadier A traditional term for heavy infantry. Jger A traditional term for light infantry (Translated "Hunter"). Gebirgsjger Traditional term for mountain and ski troops. Lehr A demonstration/training unit (Translated "Teach"). Nummer "Number" (See description in Infantry Series Divisions, below). Panzer Armored (Translated "Armored"). Sturm "Storm" or "Assault" (Translated "Storm"). Volks "of the People" (Translated "People's"). zbV Abbreviation for "zur besonderen Verwendung" Meaning "Special Purpose" (Translated "For Special Deployment"). Volks, Sturm, and Grenadier were sometimes used simply as morale-building adjectives, often without any significance to a unit's organization or capabilities. = 1st Panzer Division 2nd Panzer Division 3rd Panzer Division 4th Panzer Division 5th Panzer Division 6th Panzer Division (previously 1st Light Division) 7th Panzer Division (previously 2nd Light Division) 8th Panzer Division (previously 3rd Light Division) 9th Panzer Division (previously 4th Light Division) 10th Panzer Division 11th Panzer Division 12th Panzer Division 13th Panzer Division (previously 13th Infantry Division, 13th Motorized Infantry Division; later Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 2) 14th Panzer Division (previously 4th Infantry Division) 15th Panzer Division (previously 33rd Infantry Division; later 15th Panzergrenadier Division) 16th Panzer Division (previously 16th Infantry Division) 17th Panzer Division (previously 27th Infantry Division) 18th Panzer Division (later 18th Artillery Division) 19th Panzer Division (previously 19th Infantry Division) 20th Panzer Division 21st Panzer Division (previously 5th Light Division) 22nd Panzer Division 23rd Panzer Division 24th Panzer Division (previously 1st Cavalry Division) 25th Panzer Division 26th Panzer Division (formerly 23rd Infantry Division) 27th Panzer Division 116th Panzer Division Windhund (previously 16th Infantry Division, 16th Motorized Infantry Division, and 16th Panzergrenadier Division) 155th Reserve Panzer Division (previously Division Nr. 155, Division Nr. 155 (mot. ), Panzer Division Nr. 155) Panzer Division Nr. 178 (previously Division Nr. 178) 179th Reserve Panzer Division (previously Division Nr. 179, Division Nr. 179 (mot. ), and Panzer Division Nr. 179) 232nd Panzer Division(previously Panzer Division Tatra, Panzer Training Division Tatra) 233rd Reserve Panzer Division (previously Division Nr. 233 (mot. ), Panzergrenadier Division Nr. 233, and Panzer Division Nr. 233; later Panzer Division Clausewitz) 273rd Reserve Panzer Division = Panzer Division Clausewitz (previously Division Nr. 233 (mot. ), Panzergrenadier Division Nr. 233, and Panzer Division Nr. 233, Reserve Panzer Division 233) Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 1 (previously 60th Infantry Division, 60th Motorized Infantry Division, and Panzergrenadier Division Feldherrnhalle) Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 2 (previously 13th Infantry Division, 13th Motorized Infantry Division, and 13th Panzer Division) Panzer Division Holstein Panzer Division Jterbog Panzer Division Kempf (part Heer, part Waffen-SS) Panzer Division Kurmark Panzer Lehr Division (sometimes identified as 130th Panzer-Lehr-Division) Panzer Division Mncheberg Panzer Division Dberitz, later renamed Panzer Division Schlesien Panzer Division Tatra (later Panzer Training Division Tatra, 232nd Panzer Division) The designation "Light" (leichte) had various meanings in the German Army of World War II. There was a series of 5 Light divisions; the first four were pre-war mechanized formations organized for use as mechanized cavalry, and the fifth was an ad hoc collection of mechanized elements rushed to Africa to help the Italians and organized into a division once there. All five were eventually converted to ordinary Panzer divisions. 1st Light Division (later 6th Panzer Division) 2nd Light Division (later 7th Panzer Division) 3rd Light Division (later 8th Panzer Division) 4th Light Division (later 9th Panzer Division) 5th Light Afrika Division (later 21st Panzer Division) Various other divisions were dubbed "Light" for other reasons, and are listed among the Infantry Series Divisions. = The backbone of the Heer (German Army) was the infantry division. Of the 154 divisions deployed against Soviet Union in 1941, including reserves, there were 100 infantry, 19 panzer, 11 motorised, 9 security, 5 Waffen-SS, 4 "light", 4 mountain, 1 SS police, and 1 cavalry. A typical infantry division in June 1941 had 17,734 men organized into the following sub-units: three infantry regiments with staff and communications units three battalions with: three infantry companies one heavy weapons company one PAK company (mot.) one artillery company one reconnaissance unit one Panzerjger battalion with: three companies (each with twelve 3.7 cm guns) one artillery regiment three battalions three batteries one pioneer battalion one communications unit one field replacement battalion Supply, medical, veterinary, mail, and police German infantry divisions had a variety of designations and specializations, though numbered in a single series. The major variations are as follows: Fortress (Festung) Divisions of non-standard organization used to garrison critical sites. The smaller ones might consist of only two or three battalions. Grenadier A morale-building honorific usually indicative of reduced strength when used alone. Light, Jger Provided with partial horse or motor transport and usually lighter artillery, and reduced in size compared to an ordinary infantry division. Some of these were essentially identical to mountain divisions, and these were referred to as Gebirgsjger ("Mountain Light Infantry") divisions. This description does not apply to the Light divisions in Africa (5th, 90th, 164th, 999th), nor to the five Light mechanized divisions listed in their own subsection. Motorized Provided with full motor transport for all infantry and weapons systems. Usually reduced in size compared to an ordinary infantry division. Motorized infantry divisions were renamed Panzergrenadier (armored infantry) divisions in 1943. Division Nummer A sort of placeholder division, with a number (Nummer) and staff but few if any combat assets. These divisions started out without any type in their name (e.g., Division Nr. 179), though some acquired a type later on (e.g., Panzer Division Nr. 179). Panzergrenadier As motorized, but with more self-propelled weapons and an added battalion of tanks or fully armored assault guns. What motorized divisions were referred to from 1943 forward. Static (bodenstndige) Deficient in transport, even enough to move its own artillery. Many of these were divisions that had been mauled on the Eastern Front and were sent west to serve as coastal defense garrisons until sufficient resources were available to rehabilitate them. Volksgrenadier A late-war reorganization with reduced size and increased short-range firepower. Many previously destroyed or badly mauled infantry divisions were reconstituted as Volksgrenadier divisions, and new ones were raised as well. Their fighting worth varied widely depending on unit experience and equipment. Not to be confused with Volkssturm a national militia in which units were supposed to be organized by local Nazi party leaders; trained by the SS; and come under Wehrmacht command in combat. zbV ("zbV" is an abbreviation meaning "for special employment") An ad hoc division created to meet a special requirement. (E.g., Division zbV Afrika) Most of the size reductions listed above were by about a third, either by the removal of an infantry regiment or the removal of one infantry battalion from each of the three regiments. Infantry divisions were raised in waves, sets of divisions with a standardized table of organization and equipment. In general the later waves (i.e., the higher-numbered divisions) were of lower quality than the earlier ones. = 1st to 99thEdit 1st Infantry Division 2nd Motorized Infantry Division (later 12th Panzer Division) 3rd Motorized Infantry Division (later 3rd Panzergrenadier Division) 4th Infantry Division (later 14th Panzer Division) 5th Infantry Division (later 5th Light Infantry Division, 5th Jger Division) Not related to the 5th Light Division. 6th Infantry Division (later 6th Grenadier Division, 6th Volksgrenadier Division) 7th Infantry Division 8th Infantry Division (later 8th Light Infantry Division, 8th Jger Division) 9th Infantry Division (later 9th Volksgrenadier Division) 10th Infantry Division (later 10th Motorized Infantry Division, 10th Panzergrenadier Division) 11th Infantry Division 12th Infantry Division (later 12th Volksgrenadier Division) 13th Motorized Infantry Division (later 13th Panzer Division, Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 2) 14th Infantry Division (later 14th Motorized Infantry Division, then 14th Infantry Division again) 14th Luftwaffe Infantry Division This unit was originally in the Luftwaffe as the 14th Luftwaffe Field Division. 15th Infantry Division 15th Panzergrenadier Division (previously 33rd Infantry Division, 15th Panzer Division) Not related to 15th Infantry Division. 16th Infantry Division (later split into ) 16th Panzer Division, and 16th Motorized Infantry Division (later 16th Panzergrenadier Division, 116th Panzer Division) 16th Luftwaffe Infantry Division (later 16th Volksgrenadier Division) This unit was originally in the Luftwaffe as the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division. 17th Infantry Division 18th Infantry Division (later 18th Motorised Infantry Division, 18th Panzergrenadier Division) 18th Volksgrenadier Division Not related to the 18th Infantry Division. 19th Infantry Division (later 19th Panzer Division) 19th Grenadier Division (later 19th Volksgrenadier Division) This unit was originally in the Luftwaffe as the 19th Luftwaffe Field Division (later 19th Luftwaffe Sturm Division) 20th Motorized Infantry Division (later 20th Panzergrenadier Division) 21st Infantry Division 22nd Infantry Division (later 22nd Air Landing Division, 22nd Volksgrenadier Division) 23rd Infantry Division (later 26th Panzer Division) After being reorganized as the 26th Panzer Division, some of the 23rd Infantry Division's original components were used to create a new 23rd Infantry Division. 24th Infantry Division 25th Infantry Division (later 25th Motorized Infantry Division, 25th Panzergrenadier Division) 26th Infantry Division (later 26th Volksgrenadier Division) 27th Infantry Division (later 17th Panzer Division) 28th Light Infantry Division (later 28th Jger Division) 29th Motorized Infantry Division (later 29th Panzergrenadier Division) 30th Infantry Division 31st Infantry Division (later 31st Grenadier Division, 31st Volksgrenadier Division) 32nd Infantry Division 33rd Infantry Division (later 15th Panzer Division, 15th Panzergrenadier Division) 34th Infantry Division 35th Infantry Division (later 35th Volksgrenadier Division) 36th Infantry Division (later 36th Motorized Infantry Division, then 36th Infantry Division again, 36th Grenadier Division, and finally 36th Volksgrenadier Division) 38th Infantry Division 39th Infantry Division (later 41st Fortress Division, 41st Infantry Division) 41st Infantry Division (previously 39th Infantry Division, 41st Fortress Division) 42nd Jger Division (previously 187th Reserve Division) 44th Infantry Division (later 44th Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister) 45th Infantry Division (later 45th Grenadier Division, 45th Volksgrenadier Division) 46th Infantry Division 47th Infantry Division (previously Division Nr. 156, 156th Reserve Division;

The later epithet Fallschirm ("parachute") was purely honorific. Hermann Gring Division (later Panzer Division Hermann Gring, Parachute Panzer Division 1 Hermann Gring) Parachute Panzergrenadier Division 2 Hermann Gring To keep its existence secret, the first German airborne division was named as if a Flieger ("flier") division in the series of Luftwaffe divisions that controlled air assets rather than ground troops-named 7th Flieger Division (often translated 7th Air Division - which see: 1st Parachute Division (Germany)) The division was later reorganized to start a series of nominally airborne divisions. Though named Fallschirmjger ("paratrooper") divisions, only some of them participated in airdrops in the early part of the war, and in practice most operated as ordinary infantry throughout their existence. The lower-numbered ones earned and maintained an lite status, but quality generally declined among the higher-numbered divisions. 1st Parachute Division (April 1943 7th Flieger becomes 1st Fallschirmjger) 2nd Parachute Division 3rd Parachute Division 4th Parachute Division 5th Parachute Division 6th Parachute Division 7th Parachute Division (previously Group Erdmann, an ad hoc collection of Luftwaffe assets on the Western Front) 8th Parachute Division 9th Parachute Division 10th Parachute Division 11th Parachute Division (started to be formed March 1945. fought as battle groups only) 20th Parachute Division (Formation ordered 20 March 1945 in the Netherlands, from Parachute Training and Replacement Division. However formation was not completed beyond cadre.) 21st Parachute Division (Formation ordered 5 April 1945 in the Netherlands, as a Field-Training Division. However formation was not completed beyond cadre.) Luftwaffe Field Divisions were ordinary infantry divisions organized from Luftwaffe personnel made available after mid-war due to the manpower crunch. They were originally Luftwaffe units but were later handed over to the Heer, retaining their numbering but with Luftwaffe attached to distinguish them from similarly numbered divisions already existing in the Heer. 1st Luftwaffe Field Division 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division 3rd Luftwaffe Field Division 4th Luftwaffe Field Division 5th Luftwaffe Field Division 6th Luftwaffe Field Division 7th Luftwaffe Field Division 8th Luftwaffe Field Division 9th Luftwaffe Field Division 10th Luftwaffe Field Division 11th Luftwaffe Field Division 12th Luftwaffe Field Division 13th Luftwaffe Field Division 14th Luftwaffe Field Division 15th Luftwaffe Field Division 16th Luftwaffe Field Division Eventually transferred to the Heer as 16th Luftwaffe Infantry Division (later 16th Volksgrenadier Division) 17th Luftwaffe Field Division 18th Luftwaffe Field Division 19th Luftwaffe Field Division (later 19th Luftwaffe Sturm Division) Eventually transferred to the Heer as 19th Grenadier Division (later 19th Volksgrenadier Division) 20th Luftwaffe Field Division (later 20th Luftwaffe Sturm Division) 21st Luftwaffe Field Division (previously the Meindl Division, an ad hoc collection of Luftwaffe resources) 22nd Luftwaffe Field Division Not actually formed, its sub-units were attached to other divisions as needed. 1st Luftwaffe Training Division Parachute Training and Replacement Division-see 20th Parachute Division (Wehrmacht) These were headquarters for controlling aggregates of flak ("anti-aircraft artillery") assets rather than ordinary combined arms divisions organized for ground combat. 1st Anti-Aircraft Division 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division 4th Anti-Aircraft Division 5th Anti-Aircraft Division 6th Anti-Aircraft Division 7th Anti-Aircraft Division 8th Anti-Aircraft Division 9th Anti-Aircraft Division (lost entirely at the Battle of Stalingrad) 10th Anti-Aircraft Division 11th Anti-Aircraft Division 12th Anti-Aircraft Division 13th Anti-Aircraft Division 14th Anti-Aircraft Division 15th Anti-Aircraft Division 16th Anti-Aircraft Division 17th Anti-Aircraft Division 18th Anti-Aircraft Division 19th Anti-Aircraft Division 20th Anti-Aircraft Division 21st Anti-Aircraft Division 22nd Anti-Aircraft Division 23rd Anti-Aircraft Division 24th Anti-Aircraft Division 25th Anti-Aircraft Division 26th Anti-Aircraft Division 27th Anti-Aircraft Division 28th Anti-Aircraft Division 29th Anti-Aircraft Division 30th Anti-Aircraft Division 31st Anti-Aircraft Division All divisions in the Waffen-SS were ordered in a single series up to 38th, regardless of type. Those tagged with nationalities were at least nominally recruited from those nationalities. Many of the higher-numbered units were small battlegroups (Kampfgruppen), i.e. divisions in name only. Also Panzer Division Kempf, a temporary unit of mixed Heer and Waffen-SS components.
